"['I really like listening BUT It’s depressing how much he bounces back and forth with his weight and seems to constantly make excuses as to why he keeps gaining weight despite the podcast before he talks about making better decisions or something similar. The guy is very relatable and I enjoy listening but it seems like he doesn’t really want to lose weight. Also it seems like he is just advertising atomic habits the last several episodes and not really giving any other kinds of advice.', 'Great lessons on weight and life ', 'Love this podcast I love Dave’s honesty and relatability. He’s the kind of guy you’d want next to you in the trenches because he’ll make you laugh despite the miserable struggle. His podcast not only motivates me to lose weight but his podcast is rich with nuggets about life that have proven very effective. His skinny weight loss jingle is the highlight of my morning commute. True he’s not always successful at losing but he’s managed not to gain and has consistently followed s mostly healthy lifestyle, which is impressive. Again I cannot express how much I appreciate is honesty and his willingness to be vulnerable in an effort to help others.', 'This motivates me Dave is a highly relatable and funny guy and above all he comes across as very honest and highly transparent and trustworthy. It is true that he is moving back and forth on his journey to find his path to fat loss for life, but I prefer this 100x times more than a fake Dave that would just tell me what I would like to hear. I think that what makes his podcast so relatable is that I can find my own struggle in his honest sharing of his own struggles in his personal journey. And he has a very funny way to bring accross his point. I was once paying a monthly subscription for another motivational health podcast that I also liked a lot, but than it turned out that this guy was not telling the complete truth about his own journey and progress, but was only recording what he thought that his subscribers wanted to hear. Eventually I guess he was getting into this conflict of interest and he was sharing only worthless nothings and fillers up until people starting seeing through and cancelling their membership and the show was cancelled a few years ago. I would rather pay Dave 2x more very gladly, to support his show, which I am actually doing to a certain extent as a patronizer, than give this other podcaster even 1 dollar for his fake podcasts. Did I mentioned that Dave is very funny? Dave keep it up. I will continue frantically check my podcast app weekly to see if you have any new honest and truthfull motivational podcasts for me to listen to while I am doing my exercises on my journey to find my own fat loss path and beat my own struggles with my overweight. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!', 'I like this podcast I’m down 90 lbs since July and your podcast helps me. Thank you!', 'As a Health and Wellness Coach Been listening for several years and really enjoy Dave.

He's just you're regular guy. Things happen, his weight goes up, life goes on. You just gotta pick yourself back up & get back to eating right & exercising. This podcast has helped inspire me & over the course of several years I've lost 75 pounds. I was well over 400 pounds & I still have a ways to go. And I've been able to encourage others, like my mom who's lost around 100 now. Keep up the great work & just know you are inspiring people."", 'Logical weight loss I have listened to this podcast for several years. I absolutely love it. Why? Because Dave is perfect? Because Dave has all the answers? Nope, because Dave is like me and he is honest about his struggles. While I am totally rooting for his success, I know that some day he will get there and this podcast will end. I will feel like I lost a best friend. However, while he is still here, I am a faithful listener.', 'Awesome!!! I am not sure I agree with everything Dave says but he is honest and says he does not expect us to agree with everything. A lot of weight lost podcasts have experts have been fit and in shape for some time, Dave helps me see the real side of things, he even admits to having a hard time with soda like me. Listening helps me reflect on my own process. I also love that he talks through what works and what does not work for him. When it comes to losing weight I lose focus fast, Dave is great at telling us about new web sites or motivational tricks that I can try when I am losing strength.', 'good podcast I enjoy walking to the podcast!!

However, for the entire time I\'ve been listening to his podcasts, he has puttered around with about a 10 lb. range - this over 2 years or so. He is addicted to Mountain Dew and the entire gist of his shows is to review some web based food and exercise tracking systems or fitness ""aids"" or iPhone apps. The bottom line is, I need somebody that motivates me by example. Dave seems to be doing this podcast just to listen to himself talk. If that is the purpose of the podcast, I think there are plenty of others that have moved past the ""eat less exercise more"" mentality. And the difference between them and Dave is, their approaches actually work.', 'Great tips! ', 'Inspirational ', ""Oh boy. . . This is such a comforting podcast. The world needs David Jackson. I listen to him because he is going through similar challenges around weight loss and he learns right in front of us.

I began listening to the podcast in 2014, because I wanted to change things. But I find that Dave is still stuck in that same yo-yo dieting phase. I subscribed because I wanted to have motivation and be inspired about losing weight. Instead I’m listening to a guy who hasn’t conquered his Mountain Dew demon and dogs others on weight loss surgery. I’m not a fan of weight loss surgery but the last 2 podcast that I listened to mentioned the diet shake that he’s doing as well how his friend was going to fail because she was going to do weight loss surgery. He was negative about it but didn’t mention any positives to motivate her or be empathic to her. So no, I can’t listen anymore because he’s Oscar the grouch in human form.', ""Are you reading my mind? It's worst than listening to a whiny little girl.

"['Awesone Podcast!!! Brian, host of the London Real podcast, highlights all aspects of interesting, influential people and more in this can’t miss podcast! The host and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens!', 'A promising start but eventually falls short London Real was on a great course but podcasts have fallen short in the last year due to questionable guests. Brians interview skills are also fall short, often letting guests ramble on crazy long tangents and never challenging his guests no matter how crazy some of them get. The podcast has become disappointing in that Brian is constantly trying to bait more and more people to sign up for his podcasting classes, promising income. The reality is, most podcasters do it for the love. Those who make money from podcasts are few and far between and most successful podcast hosts such as Brian, Lewis Howes, Joe Rogan, etc... made their $$$ from other careers. Again, this show started strong but has lost its potency over the last year. Hopefully 2020 will be a comeback year.', 'My top podcast Thank you Brian for being such an open minded awesome interviewer and having guests on that are doing amazing things for the world much love my friend!', 'Great show I catch every episode. Always excellent and thoughtful content.', 'The best My absolute favorite podcast ever! Thank you for your hard work', 'Awesome podcasts! Thanks Brian and his team for their hard work and bringing such amazing people who help us be a better world. We hope to hear more from London Real!!', 'Amazing and transformative. I have been a part of this podcast since the beginning and I enjoy Brian’s transformation I am a big fan and I will continue to be part of London real.', 'Amazing!! ', 'Finally Podcast with Purpose I love the interviews, great people, very inspiring...', 'Love the podcast version Thank you so much for this amazing podcast, I love to watch on YouTube and listen while I am at the gym ... thanks that helps a lot', 'Pure value! I love this show. Can you interview Jon Kabat-zinn please, he’s got a lot to say.', 'This used to be great This is what you need. Be prepared to get addicted to a magnificent resource of information. Be prepared to change yourself.', 'Thanks Brian London Real used to be one of my favorite podcasts. But what used to be honest conversations have turned into over-monetized, over-produced, and over-marketed interviews. After sitting through minutes and minutes of self-promotion, you finally get to the interview. But now, instead of just talking to the guest and having a great conversation, Brian awkwardly tries to get certain questions asked and then charges the listener a monthly subscription fee to hear the interviewee\'s answers. And to make it worse, if you watch the interview on YouTube, you only get the first half of the interview, but Brian says you can watch the whole episode for free by registering on his site. I registered with his site and, yes, I got the ""full"" interview, but there were still sections that were blocked, being available only to paid subscribers. The podcast version here in iTunes is the same version as the non-paying, registered user on his site. So you get most of the interview, but not certain sections. The podcast also now features tons of disjointed music thrown in at various times during the interview. The music is fine and creative. But it’s totally unnecessary. Maybe if less money was spent on production, there would be less of a need to monetize the podcast to death like it currently is.', ""Don't trust this guy "", ""Only listen for the guests It occurred to me that I have been listening to this podcast for several years and never left a review. Brian Rose is one of the best interviewers alive today. London Real has given me insight into worlds I didn't know existed. It has given me an opportunity to learn from great thinkers. It caused me to look at how I was defining myself. I'll never forget the first episode I watched with Peter Sage. I still go back and check myself against Peter's insight. Look Dan Peña is right we need to take more action, but he is wrong regarding the influence this podcast has had in people's lives.

I like to download these and listen on my way to work but you're only putting out 2 minutes."", 'Great , But I’m a pretty new listener to LR and even though I get quite a bit out of listening, some things just irk me about the podcast. One being the tireless self-promotion. I understand that he has to pay the bills and all, but my god, the first ten minutes are all blah, blah, blah. Another thing is that the interviews are edited in such a way that sometimes you’re wonder if you missed something. One last one: he always asks “one last question”, and after he asks it he cuts to, you guessed it, self promotion and completely cuts out the answer. Why bother airing the question if you’re not going to play the answer? Like I said, I get quite a bit out of what is there, but I can tell it could be so much better.

Brian, host of the London Real podcast, highlights all aspects of interesting, influential people and more in this can’t miss podcast! The host and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens! A promising start but eventually falls short London Real was on a great course but podcasts have fallen short in the last year due to questionable guests. Brians interview skills are also fall short, often letting guests ramble on crazy long tangents and never challenging his guests no matter how crazy some of them get. The podcast has become disappointing in that Brian is constantly trying to bait more and more people to sign up for his podcasting classes, promising income. The reality is, most podcasters do it for the love. Those who make money from podcasts are few and far between and most successful podcast hosts such as Brian, Lewis Howes, Joe Rogan, etc... made their $$$ from other careers. Again, this show started strong but has lost its potency over the last year. Hopefully 2020 will be a comeback year. My top podcast Thank you Brian for being such an open minded awesome interviewer and having guests on that are doing amazing things for the world much love my friend! Great show I catch every episode. Always excellent and thoughtful content. The best My absolute favorite podcast ever! Thank you for your hard work Awesome podcasts! Thanks Brian and his team for their hard work and bringing such amazing people who help us be a better world. We hope to hear more from London Real!! Amazing and transformative. I have been a part of this podcast since the beginning and I enjoy Brian’s transformation I am a big fan and I will continue to be part of London real. Amazing!!  Finally Podcast with Purpose I love the interviews, great people, very inspiring... Love the podcast version Thank you so much for this amazing podcast, I love to watch on YouTube and listen while I am at the gym ... thanks that helps a lot Pure value! I love this show. Can you interview Jon Kabat-zinn please, he’s got a lot to say. This used to be great This is what you need. Be prepared to get addicted to a magnificent resource of information. Be prepared to change yourself. Thanks Brian London Real used to be one of my favorite podcasts. But what used to be honest conversations have turned into over-monetized, over-produced, and over-marketed interviews. After sitting through minutes and minutes of self-promotion, you finally get to the interview. But now, instead of just talking to the guest and having a great conversation, Brian awkwardly tries to get certain questions asked and then charges the listener a monthly subscription fee to hear the interviewee's answers. And to make it worse, if you watch the interview on YouTube, you only get the first half of the interview, but Brian says you can watch the whole episode for free by registering on his site. I registered with his site and, yes, I got the ""full"" interview, but there were still sections that were blocked, being available only to paid subscribers. The podcast version here in iTunes is the same version as the non-paying, registered user on his site. So you get most of the interview, but not certain sections. The podcast also now features tons of disjointed music thrown in at various times during the interview. The music is fine and creative. But it’s totally unnecessary. Maybe if less money was spent on production, there would be less of a need to monetize the podcast to death like it currently is. Don't trust this guy  Only listen for the guests It occurred to me that I have been listening to this podcast for several years and never left a review. Brian Rose is one of the best interviewers alive today. London Real has given me insight into worlds I didn't know existed. It has given me an opportunity to learn from great thinkers. It caused me to look at how I was defining myself. I'll never forget the first episode I watched with Peter Sage. I still go back and check myself against Peter's insight. Look Dan Peña is right we need to take more action, but he is wrong regarding the influence this podcast has had in people's lives. Thanks for having the courage to follow your path and create this platform. I look forward to what you create next. Hugely grateful. Thank you. Your last two episodes were mind blowing He doesn't seem very genuine, a real douche canoe. The FORTNITE of Podcasts..in a bad way. This guy has good guests but he him self is obnoxious. He wants to be Tim Farris so badly. His interview questions are rigid and predictable. The only thing saving the podcasts is his guests. 👍 The episodes with Ido and Rushkoff were insanely great. I had a spiritual awakening listening to Rushkoff. Keep up the good work Brian. 2 minute Jordan Peterson episode If Joe Jesus Rogan himself monetized his podcast like you did I would STILL question wether it would be worth it but YOU? You. Are. Not. Even. Remotely. In the same league. LOL Generous three stars One of top 10 podcasts on my list A+ Total Scam Artist DON'T DO HIS COURSE! Why not upload the full podcast? I like to download these and listen on my way to work but you're only putting out 2 minutes. Great , But I’m a pretty new listener to LR and even though I get quite a bit out of listening, some things just irk me about the podcast. One being the tireless self-promotion. I understand that he has to pay the bills and all, but my god, the first ten minutes are all blah, blah, blah. Another thing is that the interviews are edited in such a way that sometimes you’re wonder if you missed something. One last one: he always asks “one last question”, and after he asks it he cuts to, you guessed it, self promotion and completely cuts out the answer. Why bother airing the question if you’re not going to play the answer? Like I said, I get quite a bit out of what is there, but I can tell it could be so much better. And I’m not about to pay a subscription fee to get what I’m missing. I have my regular podcasts that I listen to that have the quality that I’m accustomed to, and if they’ve not already interviewed a certain person I’m sure it won’t be long until they will. ✌🏻 Great content, but... I was a big fan of the London Real until I did the Business Accelerator Course with them. It went from bad to worse and then hit a level that even shocked me. Mixed feelings  The flat earth discussion  A good replacement  Incredibly annoying YouTube commercials Amazing Show, but on their app you can’t download audio.

I learned more in Episode 1 than I did visiting my physicans(primary care Dr, endocrinologist, gastroenterologist, etc) Guest - Angela Gaffney  Negative and hetero-centric Angela was a wonderful addition . I especially loved her advice on owning our choices and if we are choosing Aunt Pearl’s cake just savor it . I am going to start eating more vegetables and even attempt some sweet potatoes . Just What I Needed I only got through 10 minutes of one episode before I had to turn it off. I am looking for a source that doesn’t treat menopause as a negative curse, and this just isn’t it. Using words like “suffering” and “difficulty” are really not helpful. Yes, there are challenging issues associated with menopause. But presenting a negative mindset is counter-productive to the process going smoothly in my opinion. Also, and most glaringly, There is the assumption that all listeners are heterosexual who are living with a man. This is unconscionable and reason alone to skip this podcast. Come on, people. This is 2019. Enlightening Dr, Rhonda & the experts share useful information about what menopause is about. I repeated the podcast many times and also have order some of the recommendations that will help with vaginal dryness, migraines & hormone imbalance. I will recommend this podcast to my family & friends. Much Tht Whew! Finally someone who can give us the physiological understanding of what’s happening with our hormones",46,10

Simon Mitchell’s content is clear, science based, and entertaining. Highly recommend! Best fitness podcasts out there This dude simplified weight loss for me. He is straight to the point, no bs, answers all questions and freaking hilarious on top of it all. I’ll be forever grateful to have found your page. Continue with the good content. Favorite! I never thought I would find a fitness podcast that I could enjoy more than Mindpump. Enter Simon Mitchell, who went ""straight on with it!"" There's not a more likable personality in podcasting. There is no shortage of merchants of useless supplements, Broscientists, Narcissistic Meatheads in this space. Simon is an extremely knowledgable educator, who shares useful, relevant information that if followed, will yeild results. he is entertaining and laugh out loud funny. I am going to buy something from this chap. (That's the only British word I know) I never buy anything from fitness podcasters- with the exception of Mike Matthews. He has earned my trust. Good stuff and such a funny guy! I’ve listened to most of the podcasts. I’m newish to macro counting, and I’ve learned a lot! A lot of practical info to help you towards your goals!! Plus, what a lovely accent!! :)",50,10

I’ve known of Jonathan’s work as a movement teacher and coach for years and he’s given me so much value on his blog, Uncaged Human. I’ve been waiting for him to start a podcast so that I can continue to learn and be inspired by him, so I was in the moment I heard he was coming out with one. After listening to episode 1, I’m even more excited. Can’t wait to learn more and reclaim my body! Amazing approach to physical Freedom I have been around the block I feel with physical training. I mostly had training for sports and athletics that has left me in my 30s with some injuries and immobility. His approach is a gentile approach that has helped me rehab and reclaim movements that have improved not only myself but my family. I have enjoyed his past work a lot and enjoyed listening to these podcasts. I look forward to more challenges in the future! Episode 1 Jonathan does an excellent job of providing an introduction of himself, his movement education/background, and an overview of his vision for this podcast.",50,10

This podcast is dope! :) I normally can’t stand hearing someone’s voice for too long but every episode nails it. Luka is the best of every book he has ever read wrapped into an amazing podcast. Super humble and inspiring, Luka not only makes fitness professionals want to coach their clients and have the best gym out there, his concepts can be applied really to business and life anywhere. Luka is a fitness monk / preacher man. So happy I found his work. Interrupter The interviewer interrupted the guest too often and was almost hyper about trying to interject his own expertise. It was annoying. The guest was awesome and I would have liked hearing more information from him. A must for personal trainers Episode 91 was friggin amazing. I’ve been a trainer working with clients for 10 years and consider myself to be an elite trainer. I wish I had this podcast when I first started out because in 10 years of training, going to several clinics, after several certifications, I don’t think anything was as pertinent and valuable to me as this podcast! It was a great refresher from my Precision Nutrition certification and it was so interesting listening to his application of the PN tools along with what works best. I’ll be going back to this podcast numerous times. Best Fitness (and Business) Podcast Hands down the best podcast, just sometimes feels not as loud, I have to turn the volume all the way up and sometimes still can’t hear that well. Awesome Podcast!! Luka, host of the Vigor Life Podcast, highlights all aspects of health, fitness and more in this can’t miss podcast!

Thank you Erica Now I’ve been doing the Core workouts and from the very first week I felt the difference in my body and my mood. New listener and loving it!  So much wisdom  great show This podcast was recommend by a friend after I had a baby and having a prolapse and am learning so much. All the topics are appealing and I have never skipped an episode. Thanks for the education and passion for this field. I’m hopeful again I just started listening to this podcast and have learned so much in just two episodes. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and empowering us Mama’s to not forget about ourselves! Fascia and collagen Erica’s podcast is an amazing tool if you want to upgrade your mind body and soul. She offers so much wisdom in her podcast along with easy to implement actionable tips. I love listening to her podcasts to get inspiration for a healthy life. Yay, can’t wait for more. Erica's show is full of knowledge and actionable ways for anyone who is looking to improve their health Don't miss out! I recently subscribed to this podcast & have found it to be incredibly motivating and helpful as I try to move forward with this new body of mine. I was clueless about diastasis recti prior to giving birth to my daughter, and the severity of mine contributed a lot to the post-partum depression I experienced after she was born and in the months that have followed. Erica’s knowledge & guidance in teaching about DR is patient, kind, detailed, and makes the road to recovery more approachable. I’m no longer in the “where do I start” phase, and I’m so grateful for that. I’m looking forward to each new episode & to truly healing by body and feeling the strength & control again that I had pre-baby. Thank you for all you are doing, Erica!!",50,10
