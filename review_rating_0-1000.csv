He is clearly passionate about what he does and has dedicated his life to it. What’s different is that he is educating people with the FACTS of exercise science. It’s very easy to become misguided in this day and age which can lead to long term detriments for anybody taking on any aspect of strength training and conditioning, which may even extend well beyond ones athletic career. Julian does an outstanding job of breaking down the science in a manor that’s easy to understand, and subsequently reproduce during one’s training routine. As a current holder of a B.S. in Exercise Science, I believe that this is a must listen for any and all athletes..especially young ones...as well as anyone who wishes to better themselves and increase their quality of life, the right way, through exercise. I really wish I had this resource when I was a young athlete. Keep em coming Julian!! 🤘 Must hear  Great resource for strength training athletes Such an interesting podcast to listen too, i love how it talks about athletes and needs of proper nutrition. Highly recommend ! Insightful & Refreshing Perspective This is very informative for any athlete beginning their strength training journey (especially high school and early college). Add these tips little by little into your workout plan and keep track of your results... you will see the difference.",30,6

I am relatively new to hunting (2018 will be my 4th Elk Season) but am absolutely obsessed and addicted to it. I will say that Dan’s Elk Shape youtube channel was one of the first channels of elk hunting videos that influenced my desire to put away the rifle and pick up a bow. In the past couple of years I have listened to hundreds of hrs of every single bow hunting/elk hunting/back country podcast out there (and there are many) and the Elk Shape podcast has become one of my favorites. One thing I love about Dan’s podcast is the variety of hard working, blue collar dudes, that are finding success in the elk woods year after year, and are for the most part unheard of in the industry, which to most of us are more relatable. I love hearing their stories and learning from their successes as well as the mistakes they share. While driving to Total Archery Challenge this past July I listened to 10 solid hrs of Elk Shape and could not get enough of it. This year 2018 will be my first year with the bow and hopefully I have put in enough hrs and shortened the learning curve enough to find success myself. So Dan the fitness man Mr. Elk Shape thank you for what you are doing to bring us this valuable information, I now you are a busy man but your work ethic, determination and passion for elk hunting is inspiring. Look forward to meeting you someday as we have quite a few things in common.', 'Rude to guest ', 'Amazing podcast I love Dans approach to family, fitness and hunting.

Great Podcast Initially I didn’t listen to Elk Shape because I assumed Elk Shape was specifically fitness related, an assumption that was completely wrong. So glad I started listening and now I will stop midway through other podcasts and switch to Elk Shape when I see a new one has dropped.

One of my favorite aspects of Dan’s perspective and what he carries through in Elk Shape is the humility and the simplicity : work hard and delayed gratification.

I’ve been a fan of Emily’s for a long time, but I just recently started getting into podcasts. I binged all of her episodes quickly because they are so informative and powerful. Em is so knowledgeable about health and fitness and always backs her claims up with science. This is such a refreshing take in a world full of influencers who don’t always think about what they’re saying or speak from a place of misinformation. Em does NOT do that.

I’m getting my degree in biology so I’m a total science nerd and Emily does a great job explaining studies and concepts in a way that is so applicable and clear. I always learn something new.

Emily is amazing ❤️ I’ve never walked away from listening to one of Emily’s podcasts without feeling richer in knowledge and empathy. What she has to offer goes beyond physical health, it’s health and wellness in all aspects: physically, spiritually, emotionally, and mentally. When people think about getting healthy, they think nutrition and hitting the gym. But that’s just the beginning. It opens up doors to all kinds of wellness, and Emily touches and explores every one of those. My life has truly been enriched as not only a trainer, but a human, because of the content she brings to her followers.', 'So glad the podcast is back! I’ve been following you for YEARS through sm but have just recently started listening to your podcasts.

Some good info, gratuitous cursing though Really enjoyed some of the content, but constant F bombs seem a bit unnecessary. real, raw & educational? I couldn’t ask for more I love love love this podcast & have been bingeing then on my walks! You can listen to any episode and learn so much! Keep up the good work Emily! Educational, funny & relatable I love this podcast. Every episode I learn something new or I hear a new perspective that opens my eyes to a different way of thinking. Emily’s content across all platforms is informative & relatable but I especially love the podcast bc I can listen while I work, drive, etc and I feel like I’m being more productive because I’m actually learning. I’m currently studying for the CPT exam and I’ve been binging this podcast. 15/10 recommend. Best fitness advice especially for the uninformed Hey Em! I love you science back, FACTS approach to explaining things in the health and fitness industry. I love that you don’t sugar coat things with the “self-love” blanket that is so popular these days. I’d love to hear an episode dedicated to us women that are over weight, eating way too many calories, and not doing an hour of cardio of day, that explains to us were to start. (I.E the coming up with goals that aren’t body composition based) as a little get-started-guide because I feel your knowledge is soo valuable especially to those of us desperate for change and reaching for all the “fast fix” “MLM” schemes. Your podcast is so refreshing and makes me feel likes theirs hope it true science and that the fitness industry is remaining SCIENTIFIC and isn’t being swallowed by societies current insecurities and definitions of beauty. Couldn’t give 10 stars so I had to give 5. 😜 Hi Emily, I’m fairly new to your podcast, although I’ve been following you on social media for years. Somehow, someway I didn’t know about your podcasts until about three weeks ago and boy am I hooked. I listen to them when I’m getting ready in the morning, driving, even in the shower. Your podcasts are sooo full of knowledgeable and research proven information. Most podcasts about research and the fitness industry are typically boring, but your approach keeps my attention, and makes it so easy to understand while making it enjoyable to listen to! I love your podcasts so much and I’m so thankful to have came across them. Can’t wait to see what all you have coming to the podcast in the future! An Educational Chat with A Good Friend  Awesome podcast for beginner in fitness world!  So much education/ distracting background noise I started following Emily when she had about 16,000 followers back in the day. Aside from how knowledgeable and charismatic she is, my favorite thing about her and her content is how passionate she is about providing science-backed information about health and fitness to her listeners/followers in a way that people who don’t have a science background can understand. Listening to EmBody Radio is truly like sitting down for coffee with a girlfriend (or boyfriend?) and talking about the good, the bad, and the ugly in the health and fitness industry. If you don’t follow her on every platform she inhabits, you need to. Thank you for all you do, Emily! Emily Duncan's impact on my fitness journey and life advice Emily does a great job of combining science and personal experience with nutrition, training, and mental health to create an awesome podcast for those just starting out in fitness or those that have been doing it for awhile. I always walk away from each podcast with at least 1 new piece of information! Amazing! I appreciate all the topics you cover, but I had to mention Luna in the background is extremely distracting. I find myself listening to her collar jingle and things moving around. Other than that, I love love love all your episodes. Thanking the universe you’re back Hey girl! I am very new to your family and I am absolutely hooked! Your rawness, poise, grace, kindness, knowledge and overall presence is so life giving to me. I genuinely enjoy all of your stories, posts, binge watch your videos because of how much knowledge(I'm also a fitness nerd that loves to know the why and how of things pertaining to life and our bodies) and how thoughtfully executed your content is. You genuinely care about us and want to feed us accurate information that we can use instead of just watching, reading and listening to for pure entertainment and enjoyment. I am so tired of fitspos and taking in meaningless content that doesn't curate or inspire life change, its just pure air. You are so much different than that and I AM SO GLAD TO BE APART OF YOUR AMAZINGLY ACCEPTING AND KNOWLEDGEABLE SOCIAL MEDIA FAMILY! DO NOT STOP! Ur a blessing ❤️❤️ Just plain awesome. Thank you for this EmDunc I’ve been following Em on IG for a few years and just recently got into podcasts and hers takes the cake! I’ve been into fitness for years but just recently fell off the wagon. She is so helpful and motivating, if you need a kick in the butt definitely listen to her! My favorite fitness podcast I have been following Emily for a couple year on Instagram. About a year ago I started getting into podcasts and found hers and IMMEDIATELY fell in love. I couldn’t get enough, I would listen to it non stop on the stair master, in the car, while making my food, etc. Not only does she provide phenomenal content for people in (and out) of the fitness community, she has the most soothing voice EVER lol. She’s wise beyond her years and is relatable no matter what background you’re from. I can learn something new from her and she makes me want to apply it ASAP. I had the honor to meet her at the Arnold this past March and I was so blown away by the warmth that radiated from her. She’s a boss. It’s good to have her back in my ears. Follower of 4ish years I’ve been following Emily on Instagram for some time now and she’s one of the biggest reasons I started to *properly* start my fitness journey with motivation and inspiration, and her scientific approach! I am so so happy I stumbled upon this lovely lady, and this podcast just makes everything more impactful. You’re one of the best parts of this industry, thank you for everything you give us ! A never ending black hole of knowledge and info I have listened to so many fitness podcasts and this is my favorite! Emily is very knowledgeable, but is never arrogant. She brings on well respected experts in the fields of exercise and nutrition and does the best job interviewing them. She is prepared with excellent questions, but is always listening to them (not just preparing to ask her next question) and has a great conversation with everyone she has on her show. I’ve listened to her interview experts that I’ve heard on other podcasts and have learned more from them on her podcast. Her voice is lovely to listen to and the sound quality is great. So educational! Happy to see you back and better than ever!!!! You’re making a big comeback 🤟🏻💕 Why didn’t I listen earlier? Emily and her interviewees never cease to bring delightful and witty information to the table. It is refreshing to have someone so knowledgeable about a plethora of subjects speak in ways that are so easy to understand. I love the episodes that talk about training and ways to increase/change training. As someone who enjoys being in the gym, getting tips and advice (fo free might I add 👏🏻👏🏻) from reputable and qualified professionals helps me so much. Love love love this podcast, it is a HUGE motivator to get out and get heathy! Thank you so much Em and everyone else on the show- ya’ll Rock so much 🙏🏻 LIFESAVER I’ve been following Emily on Instagram for a couple years now and I just became a frequent podcast listener, so I decided to give her channel a listen. MY GOD she knows what she’s talking about. I highly recommend her podcasts to those who want to dig deeper and learn more about our bodies, and wants to better themselves both physically and mentally. So motivational!! I just started listening to your podcast, and let’s just say, i’m so happy I did. Not only do I learn more about health and fitness overall, but I am learning how to cope and understand MY body better. I will definitely make time to listen to at leas one episode every day. Thank you for keeping it real on your podcast. Truly powerful Just have to tell you, I started listening to your podcasts during my cardio everyday. Now I don’t even listen to music in the car, I just turn them on! They speak right to me in so many aspects. Everything I have wondered or gone through, you have something to say about that grounds me. You have such a powerful message. It’s so refreshing to see such a real person in such a fake world. Thank you for being you! Keep sharing your voice! Everyone needs to here it! Cup of tea, a notebook, and this podcast I started listening to your podcast just on ones that sparked my interest, but then wanted to go back and start from the beginning! I love hearing your journey, you are so straight forward and say it how it is! I truly enjoy gaining knowledge from each podcast and look forward to new ones. Health in all aspects. I’ve been a fan of Emily’s for a long time, but I just recently started getting into podcasts. I binged all of her episodes quickly because they are so informative and powerful. Em is so knowledgeable about health and fitness and always backs her claims up with science. This is such a refreshing take in a world full of influencers who don’t always think about what they’re saying or speak from a place of misinformation. Em does NOT do that. She’s honest and real all the time. EMBody Radio is definitely one of my top favorite podcasts. I think everyone could benefit from giving Emily Duncan a listen. From Emily, To Emily. Thanks for being you! I found this show when I was looking for resources to educate myself more on nutrition and training. I’m getting my degree in biology so I’m a total science nerd and Emily does a great job explaining studies and concepts in a way that is so applicable and clear. I always learn something new. She is one of the most informative voices I have found in an industry flooded with bro-science and instagram models. Thanks for teaching and inspiring me, Emily! Love this podcast! Emily is amazing ❤️ I’ve never walked away from listening to one of Emily’s podcasts without feeling richer in knowledge and empathy. What she has to offer goes beyond physical health, it’s health and wellness in all aspects: physically, spiritually, emotionally, and mentally. When people think about getting healthy, they think nutrition and hitting the gym. But that’s just the beginning. It opens up doors to all kinds of wellness, and Emily touches and explores every one of those. My life has truly been enriched as not only a trainer, but a human, because of the content she brings to her followers. So glad the podcast is back! I’ve been following you for YEARS through sm but have just recently started listening to your podcasts. You have such a wide variety of topics that you discuss and all are backed with scientific facts. And I love that every single guest is as knowledgeable and credible as you are. It’s hard to listen to an episode without learning new information and gaining better perspective on whatever it is your discussing. All of your topics are so interesting- it’s like Netflix, I could scroll for hours just trying to decide which to listen to bec they are all great!!",142,30

Eric always explains why you should do a particular training protocol. Keep up the good work and thank you for sharing your knowledge. Because Eric said so. It’s awesome that Eric brings new information into the game. No other podcast is doing this and Eric is killing it. I took one star away though because he tends to ramble a lot about somewhat unrelated stuff, makes it hard to listen to sometimes. I’ll keep listening, but I might curate which episodes I choose because of this. incredibly detailed, expertly explained I have listened to nearly every episode at least twice these past few years. By far my favourite climbing related podcast. Getting into the nitty gritty of the sport science and always at the forfront of scientific research. Thank you Coach Hörst!",133,30

I’ve been watching fitness and lifestyle youtubers for years now and I’ve seen Emily’s content around and watched her make appearances in some of my favorite channels.

Within 2 days I have listened to all her episodes to date and I can’t speak highly enough of her. I’ve always been into “self help” style books, podcasts, etc. but I’ve never experienced the resonance and connect I have with Evolve with Emily. The way she explains her views and shares her stories makes it so easy to connect with her. She sounds like the supportive best friend who’s not afraid to call you out you’ve always wanted.

Thank you for jumping into this platform!! Your own personal cheerleader This podcast is to the point with extremely inspiring and heartfelt information! I normally don’t listen to podcasts but I love listening to Emily and by practicing what she says to do in her episodes I have already seen a difference in myself! My new favorite thing is to listen to her episodes! BOOYAH I’ve been following you on IG forever, but until you started doing this Podcasts is when I felt like I truly do know you. Such a positive and loving person is what you transmit, and so true to yourself it’s comforting because there’s not many people like you in the world left. I love this Emily, thank you. Even when I’ve played all your podcast I still go back and replay them. ♥️ Empowering and Inspiring! Wow Im so glad I found you. Helped me get motivated right now that I am going through rough times. Thank you. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ I’ve been following Emily Hayden for years now, so I can say with certainty that she knows what she’s talking about. “Evolve With Emily” is such a perfect title for this podcast because she is a master of evolving and improving in her own life. 🖤 Love you Emily! Obsessed I’ve been watching Emily’s YouTube videos for over a year and absolutely adore her energy so of course I was excited when I heard about her podcast. Every time that I listen to one of her episodes, I feel like I have a cheerleader in my head, telling me that I can do anything. I love that she gives us wonderful advice but also “homework” on the steps that we need to take to achieve our goals. If you’re looking for kick in the bum with a genuine attitude, press play. I love her! This podcast far surpasses any “hype” music I could listen to while busting my buns and sweating buckets in the gym. I feel related to and spoken for in the most affirming way! Emily not only speaks from her heart of her OWN life but relates each lesson to every profession and passion. Faith journey! I’ve been watching fitness and lifestyle youtubers for years now and I’ve seen Emily’s content around and watched her make appearances in some of my favorite channels. I stumbled across her podcast this week, already having an idea of what she’s about, I wanted to check it out. I am more than impressed! Within 2 days I have listened to all her episodes to date and I can’t speak highly enough of her. I’ve always been into “self help” style books, podcasts, etc. but I’ve never experienced the resonance and connect I have with Evolve with Emily. The way she explains her views and shares her stories makes it so easy to connect with her. She sounds like the supportive best friend who’s not afraid to call you out you’ve always wanted. Her episodes are personal and motivating. Just in this past week I know that she has inspired me to take action towards becoming who I’ve always wanted to be. Best Podcast Ever!!  Evolve 🦋 I love how positive she is ... This girl has a knowing 🖤 makes me feel good about my obstacles 🙂 Keep them coming 💕 Literally obsessed and I’ve only listened to four episodes. The tools you’re providing us with are so dope. Your outlook on life is so refreshing. Wish I had more people like you in my circle! Xoxo Listened to Every Episode and I’m OBSESSED! I have a job where I sit at a desk and I can listen to music or YouTube videos or podcasts and I never really found a podcast from a female‘s point of view that really stood out to me, until I came across Amanda! What I really love about her podcast is that not only does she motivate us for the moment but also gives us tools to keep that motivation going even when the podcast is over to ensure we thrive all day/week. For example today I have my headphones in and it’s going to be a long day at work so I’m just listening to one after another since I just found her podcast earlier this week. Thank you for this podcast! 100% Real!!! Loved, loved, loved your podcast about your secret weapon! I am glad you are able to share about this important part of who you are with us. Our faith is so vital and helps us all connect together! Best wishes on your journey! Thanks for your inspiration Emily! One of the great ones! These podcasts are so amazing & inspiring!!! Emily you do a great job!! Every time I listen I can’t wait for the next one to come out :-) AMAZING Emily, you speak to my soul. Anyone who is looking at this comment needs to go listen to episode 11: Evolve RIGHT NOW! You have brought out so many emotions through this episode. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Keep inspiring beautiful ♥️ This woman WILL change your life! So many feelings as I listen to Emily’s voice shake in Episode 12: My Secret Weapon. I absolutely love this Godly woman who speaks so much truth that ultimately touches every part of the soul. a great girl!  In your face truth!! So many feels. Thank you for sharing your life and lessons ❤️ each episode touches my soul deeper than the last. Sooo excited to come to the evolve with Emily retreat 🙌🏻 The action steps you give create change and it’s truly powerful. Thank you 😊 Hugs Highly recommend I’ve been a long-time fan of Emily for such a long time, and she’s truly an inspiration for everything I do. Her video with Andy Frisella as the narrator motivated me to my core. Her hard work echoes in everything she does. She is literally the reason why I became a Legionnaire! But this podcast to me is everything. I feel like she talks about topics that I preach about on my platform and it’s so refreshing to hear it from her perspective. Her tips and advice get me through the morning when I get ready for work. She’s straight to the point and I’m absolutely in love with hearing how her story molded her into the person she is today. She is the realest athlete you’ll ever listen to and she’ll get you into that right mindset of whatever it is you’re about to tackle. Thank you Emily for your continuous motivation and inspiration for me and other females around the world ❤️ Inspirational.

I am so excited about this podcast. Emily has encouraged me throughout the years to do things I’ve never thought were possible.

And I did not leave a review until I could confidentially say this is a great podcast! I am a woman in my 20s who is struggling to gain weight dealing with hypoglycemia and low blood pressure/blood sugar, making working out a stressor as I’m worried about passing out. I have been working out with an awesome trainer for a year, but recently he had to move on from training due to life situations. I was bounced around to a bunch of bad trainers who made reaching my health goals a challenge. For example, I am a woman who loves to lift heavy, but was told by one of these new trainers that lifting heavy was going to make me look like a man! 😂 With all the knowledge in this podcast, I have been able to drop my dependence on a trainer and create my own motivation to head to the gym solo and lift heavy on my own! I am feeling great, gaining weight, and I’m so motivated to reach my goals! Thanks Josh and Kyle! What you do is amazing!', 'Underrated content This podcast has changed my life mentally and physically. There’s nothing more rewarding then treating your body right.

Keep it going! so much knowledge, it’s almost hard to believe it’s free content i normally listen to my podcasts on spotify including this one but i just had to come on here and drop a pretty hefty review because these guys absolutely deserve it. i don’t even know why it took me this long to do it lol i almost feel ashamed for consuming all this amazing content without giving credit where it’s due (i’m sorryy). anywayyy being a beginner in this whole fitness thing, i didn’t know where to begin. there’s so much noise & so much information that contradict each other that i kind of felt overwhelmed and almost gave up. however, i came across these two beauties at the right time. at first i was honestly not that into it because the episodes were too short to my liking. i tend to listen to my podcasts on my walks or at work so i was looking for long duration podcasts. i gave it a try nonetheless and i ended up binging every single episode until i was caught up. the amount of knowledge dropped on every episode absolutely helped me in so many ways. every time i have a question in mind about anything fitness related, i find an episode that covers it. it’s almost impossible to believe. i started taking notes (don’t judge) and i started referring certain episodes to friends — that’s when i realized how convenient it was that the episodes were quick and straight to the point. i powered through the crappy audio phase and wowza look at them now!! this podcast is literally the epitome of quality over quantity!! these guys are not here to sell you things. they are here to genuinely help people and share their knowledge and experiences. i very much appreciate josh & kyle !! Amazing & For EVERYONE I have been listening to this podcast on Spotify for many months. And I did not leave a review until I could confidentially say this is a great podcast! I am a woman in my 20s who is struggling to gain weight dealing with hypoglycemia and low blood pressure/blood sugar, making working out a stressor as I’m worried about passing out. I have been working out with an awesome trainer for a year, but recently he had to move on from training due to life situations. I was bounced around to a bunch of bad trainers who made reaching my health goals a challenge. For example, I am a woman who loves to lift heavy, but was told by one of these new trainers that lifting heavy was going to make me look like a man! 😂 With all the knowledge in this podcast, I have been able to drop my dependence on a trainer and create my own motivation to head to the gym solo and lift heavy on my own! I am feeling great, gaining weight, and I’m so motivated to reach my goals! Thanks Josh and Kyle! What you do is amazing! Underrated content This podcast has changed my life mentally and physically. There’s nothing more rewarding then treating your body right. As Kyle once said we only have one body and we have to treat it right and I feel like I used to put everything above my fitness and health and listening to you guys has changed my thinking. Thanks for being consistent and giving us content weekly to look forward to. You guys are truly the best. Genuine This podcast comes off as very personal and genuine but it’s also fun and informative! They don’t try to push sales on you like a lot of others on this platform, they just give out free content and advice that’s very beneficial! Love the podcast!  2 weeks of Josh & KG, great fitness knowledge Love that you guys know what your talking about. Very knowledgeable, I’ve listening to some episodes a few times to really soak in all the info you guys provide. Very helpful First off if your about feeling good, eating right, and working out properly this is a great pod cast to listen to for tips, motivation, and just over all good habits in fitness. They bust allot of fitness myths that people really need to hear about. The host Josh and Kyle keep the pod cast pretty fresh considering I was able to fill my ears for two weeks straight listening to all 137 episodes and wanting to listen to another again and again. So stop reading my review and just start listening.",50,10

You get some great advice (real advice?) and stories about running, but you also get to hear about instant pots, movie reviews, weird bathroom stories, and a whole host of other things you aren't quite sure you wanted to know - but hell, it's fun to be along for the ride. My biggest compliment? They *clearly* respect the female running community and regularly have wonderful women on as guests. Nicely done, gentlemen. Love it! Love listening to these guys. whether I'm out for a run or on the treadmill they help pass the time and keep me smiling the whole time! Yes Great conversation, great guests and content, not to mention wonderful audio quality! Podcast Highlight of My Week! Car talk for running, love it",50,10

Lastly, we don't have any Jivamukti teachers where I live (or if we do, none of them are teaching anywhere that I've heard of), and these podcasts have helped me maintain a connection with a practice that, it turns out, means the world to me. Frustrating  thebiglebroadski I would love this but at the start of every pose I don’t know what pose we’re in, whether we’re standing, sitting, lying on belly or back..listening to the podcast. Not sure if there’s a video version somewhere. Wonderful Teachings Fabulous! Trust your dopeness.Jivamukti-ing in Musqat, Oman Podcasts Jessica-ji has the ability to articulate instructions so clearly that these are the perfect classes to do on the road.

"['Better late than never I am glad I found you guys. I have been doing CrossFit for the past 9 years and coaching for about 6 then one day I decided to sign up for an Ultra Marathon. I have been listening to a number of pod casts on my runs rather than music and one day found you guys. I love the banter and it nice to hear about balancing the lifting and the running. My race is this weekend and I plan on listening to you guys for a few miles along the way. Keep up what you do and it is good to know there are other Crossfitters that run these crazy things.', 'F3 Memphis ', 'Fun Friends for my 2 favorite sports! I wish I had heard this podcast sooner. I have been a part of F3 Memphis for the past 6 months, and it has been an enormous contributing factor to my life changing for the better. Physically, mentally, and spiritually, F3 memphis has been so important. I think you should check back in with the group to see how it’s grown. They work with GoRuck now to set up F3 only events, we have a team preparing for the Memphis half Ironman, there are just so many legit athletes here now it’s incredible.', 'Your fav fitness friends As an ultra runner and a CrossFitter, this podcast is perfect! It is unusual for these to sports to be in the same room so I look forward every week to this podcast. However, I like to watch on YouTube. These folks are fun to listen (and watch) too. I like how they interact with each other. Thanks for combining the 2 best sports that have ever existed in one pod!', 'Here for the cup I’ve been meaning to write a review for a long time & iTunes finally made it easy to do so, and also I’d love a cool hat from Peter M! I listen to this podcast every week for updates in the local running/fitness community as well as to laugh along with Amanda, Brian, Von & Wilson. They make running, lifting, crossfitting, racing, etc accessible & fun for anyone no matter where you are in your journey. They also inspire me to test my limits and try new things in the fitness world because that’s what they do and they make it sound so dang fun doing it. I know these people in real life and this is the group of fitness folks you just want to be surrounded by. Keep being awesome guys! And Wilson, I wouldn’t lie to you about your heater or anything else even if I’m to married Dane :)', 'Hummer or shaker bottles I’ve been planning to write a review for a while, but like everything in life it seems like I need a little extra nudge; the shaker cup giveaway was just what the doctor ordered! The LHRL podcast is exactly what you need in your life if you need the motivation to keep pushing forward in your running and lifting goals. These guys are always honest about where they are in their fitness journey and it is refreshing to hear from “normal” people doing their best through the ups and downs. Keep up the great work!', 'Favorite podcast ', ""I don't even lift heavy "", 'Love this Sh*t Love LHRL. Real people real life!', 'Keeping it real with none of that “tiptoe thru the tulips” BS!
