Absolute Strength,"All things Strength (physical, mental and spiritual)We'll hear from everyday people that are the true embodiment of Absolute Strength. Hunter talks about being the FNG and how he loves learning. The beginner mindset and how he's comfortable in it."
AbundanCEO,"For a womxn on the move -- we're a resource for aspiring entrepreneurs who want to live purposeful lives and need a little support. Your co-hosts, Maria and Alex  found each other working their 9-5's and later went to build their own businesses. They’ve experienced major highs and lows, and like many CEOs realized that the business of making a business gets hard AF. So they decided it’s way more fun if you join them on the never-ending journey. This podcast is equal parts real talk and practical advice for anyone who wants more from life than a 9-5. Fueled by a healthy dose of brutal honesty, deep dives into fears and personal stories plus your very own actionable steps toward your dreams. We're baaaaack! And we're kicking off Season 2 with a 4-part episode series. We asked you what you wanted to hear about next and we listened. You asked ""how can I quit my job or start a business with $0 in the bank""? So we’re going there in this episode. In this first episode Maria and Alex share their start-up stories. Maria shares how she budgeted a brick and mortar business with no savings, while Alex takes us back in time when she first made the financial leap with her apparel company using ""intuition based budgeting"" and her monthly budget plan. Our 4-part conversation about all things money, starts here. This is our final week of the abundance challenge, where we’re getting better and better at operating from a place of abundance instead of scarcity. 

This week is a BIG week — it’s time to tell the world about what you’ve been up to. Say you you want to leave your high-paying IT gig with crazy good benefits and be a professional photographer, and now you have to break the news to your mom. We don’t care if you’re 20 or 45, —  all of us at one time or another feel fearful of other’s reactions. It’s especially challenging if we know that people we care about will not understand. How will they react? What will they think? What will they say? Now it’s time to rip that band-aid! The biggest gift you can give yourself on this challenge is to be to true yourself.

The convos are taking place on our IG @_abundanceo, we’d love to hear your thoughts. Who did you tell? How did this 30 day challenge make a difference in your life? This is week 3 of our abundance challenge, where we’re getting better and better at operating from a place of abundance instead of scarcity. 

This week, we make contact and meet some people. Sometimes we get caught up in “the steps” and can think that there is a clear and linear path to “success”. But the more we get exposed to people who follow their dreams, the more we see that that’s just not true.

Reach out to someone who’s doing what you want to do (or someone simply living the life of their dreams), and ask them how they got there. It may seem intimidating at first, but you might be surprised that there are people out there that are willing to talk to you. This step is especially important for those of us who are not surrounded by doers and makers, and instead surrounded any complainers and nay-sayers. 

The convos are taking place on our IG @_abundanceo, we’d love to hear your experience. Tell us, how did it go this week? Today we’re continuing our 30 day abundance challenge, where we’re spending the next 30 days training ourselves to operate form a place of abundance instead of scarcity — which we believe is key for business. For this week’s challenge, we take it a step further. And get ready, because this one is not easy. 

This week, say “no” to an idea or project that does not resonate with you but is difficult to pass up. Saying “no” to something can be challenging, especially if it means we can “lose out” on money, let someone down, or “pass up” a crazy good opportunity. For example, you want to quit your job, but your boss just offers up a raise and a fancy new title. Or your friend asks you for help, but you are tired and depleted and you feel bad saying no. Take a look at your opportunities and to-do lists —whether professional or personal — that you just know in your heart are not meant for you. Say “NO”.

The convos are taking place on our IG  @_abundanceo, we’d love to hear how you’re doing with this one! What is surprising about saying “no”? Was it easier than you thought? Today we kick off our 30 day abundance challenge! This is where we’ll spend the next 30 days training ourselves to operate form a place of abundance instead of scarcity, which we believe is key for business. 

This week, take a “time out” from people or a person who is not supportive of your new venture, interest or lifestyle. This can mean that you take more space from the person in an obvious way or just energetically remove yourself from having to explain yourself, and notice how that feels. Did your energy level shift? What else is different?

The convos are taking place on our IG, we’d love to hear how you’re doing with this one! Is there such a thing as too many ideas? Do we multi-task and test the waters on multiple projects/businesses, or focus on one? If you’re an idea machine or trying to figure out which business idea to act on, in today’s episode, Maria and Alex describe different ways they focus their time.

They discuss how they structure their to-do lists and talk about their approaches — Alex is a “multi-tasker”, while Maria focuses her time primarily on one idea at a time. They also share what happens when they get stuck, face challenges, get burnt out or want to quit."

Achilles Running Podcast,"Wir sprechen mit enstpannten und kompetenten Menschen, die sich mit Laufen, Fitness, Gesundheit und Ernährung auskennen. www.achilles-running.de Ein Halbmarathon ist kein halber Marathon. So ganz und gar nicht. Und ein Halbmarathon ist auch nicht weniger Wert als ein Marathon. Es ist eine eigene Disziplin und sollte auch so betrachtet werden. Mit diesem Ansatz haben wir wieder unseren Laufcoach Lucas Przygodda zu uns gebeten. Wir durchsprechen den gesamten Fahrplan: von den Voraussetzungen über die langen Laufen bis hin zum wohlverdienten Wettkampf.

Sie will mit ihrer Geschichte Aufmerksamkeit generieren und Spenden sammeln. Alle zwei Jahre bei einem Marathon für eins ihrer Herzensprojekte. Nachdem sie im vergangenen Jahr in Düsseldorf die 42,195 km besiegt hat, steht im März 2020 Barcelona an. Dieses Mal will sie Geld für eine Ballettschule für sehbehinderte und blinde Kinder in Brasilien sammeln.

Im Achilles-Running-Podcast erzählt die Deutsch-Brasilianerin vom Verlust ihrer Sehfähigkeit, wieso sie mit ihrer Sehbeinträchtigung auch mal provozieren will und warum sie schon wie ein Frosch durch die Düsseldorfer Innenstadt gehopst ist.

Veganuary is a movement which has picked up pace in the last few years and this year is no different.

In todays podcast I talk you through the Veganuary setup and how you can take part, then I cover the latest statistics on animal agriculture, Our environment, health and how going vegan could drastically improve each of these areas.

Connors blood work. Blood testing is becoming more accessible and Liam talks through how best to interpret your results, the dangers of doing one-off testing, why you need to use subjective markers as well and his experience with testing elite athletes.

We covered macronutrients and calorie splits and spoke about the issues of eating a higher calorie plant based diet. 

Liam then walked us through the 6 week program and explained why the program is split into 3 phases - 
Weeks 1-2 - building your baseline
Weeks 3-4 - Adjust and personalise
Weeks 5-6 - Assess and progress
Connor and Liam will be posting updates via instagram (@ph_nutrition) and @plantbasedgames and if there are any questions please reach out to us both!

We are off to lift, eat and get strong.

Listen, share and enjoy! In preparation for the Plant Based Based Games Performance nutritionist Liam Holmes joined me on the podcast to breakdown everything athletes need to know about how to fuel themselves for competition. We covered pre comp and the weeks leading up to the event, comp day - the morning of competing, during and in between workouts/days and also post comp. It was really interesting to hear about how planned nutrition can be and the fact that practicing eating certain snacks during training in the lead up to the event will enable to workout which foods suit you best for the performance you want. Another important point which we covered was that it all comes down to each individual athlete, there is no one size fits all when it comes to nutrition. Going off you own experiences will be the most important information you will receive. 

A fascinating topic we talked about was a programmed designed by Liam called ""How to be a fitter women"".  -The tried, tested, and proven system that rejuvenates female health, eliminates the crippling issues that affect you around your menstrual cycle, handle hormonal chaos with ease, and enhance your functional fitness performance to the levels that you dream of.
Without crazy cleanses, detoxes, extreme diets, and complete lifestyle overhaul.

No stone has been left unturned in the quest to design products that taste great, use the finest ingredients available, contain zero additives and are affordable.

AdapNation: all things Self-Optimisation!,"All things Self-Optimisation! A deep dive Podcast, digging into practical ways to optimise your wellness, body and mind. Helping you #BeYourBest  ~Steve Katasi. Mattias Ribbing, aka Grand Master of Memory, walks us through his most powerful techniques and concepts behind developing a strong memory, that in turn optimises learning and super charges our ability to understand. 
Mattias held the Swedish Memory Champion title for three years in a role, and was internationally named the Grandmaster of Memory. Competing in memory sports, he would do things such as quickly memorising 1060 random digits without a mistake! 
Today, however, Mattias is the author of four books and a renowned speaker. His focus is no longer on spectacular feats of memory, but instead helping children and adults massively improve their ability to learn through engineering understanding and remembering through visualisation.
Memory is so much more than an ability to reel off some facts, remember someones name, or recite a phone number. Memory is the cornerstone of human experience, and a stronger memory will enrich your life. From learning new things and developing new ideas to vividly recalling past experiences and designing your best life based on your acquired wisdom.
So, if you wish you could remember more of what you read or listened to - both the main ideas as well as the details, then this episode is a must! If you want to develop your expertise, make maths easier, and generally remember more of your life, then Mattias offers some incredible yet simple insights into how great minds do it.

Menno is know for many things, including his support of the sciences, his enviable physique, and world class coaching practice. But the biggies are most probably his positions on Training Volume, Training Frequency and Training Recovery to maximise muscle growth.

We’ll cover Menno’s thoughts on Consistency, Training Volume, Progressive Overload, Rep Ranges, Intensiveness, Training to Failure, Recovery, Frequency, periodisation and a few other things too.

Sticking to the AdapNation ritual, Bryn and Steve get together with hot drink in hand just before Christmas, to look back at the year just been and honestly self-reflect on our performance and satisfaction. Oh, and a biiiiiig announcement…. 
Did we do what we said we would? Have we lived up to our values and expectations? Did we miss the target on any of our 2019 declared themes? Were there any pleasant surprise victories along the way? 
It’s such a cathartic and and inspiring process. Hopefully our honesty, reflection and questions spark a similar process for you and those close to you. 
 
Here’s the format of our reflection &amp; planning - https://adapnation.io/111-2019-reflections-and-big-announcement
 
HUGE Announcement!

If you like this and other AdapNation episodes, please don't forget to subscribe to the channel, as well as leaving a 5 star review and letting friends and family know of this Podcast on Social Media. Dr. Bill Schindler, the hands-on anthropologist and archeologist, and overall student of prehistoric and indigenous cultures and tooling, joins us today for what is a truly fascinating and thought provoking discussion on our evolution as a species.
Bill’s on a mission to take the archaeological record and get the truth out there to the masses. He believes is we can all better understand our evolutionary past, and what critical nutritional and tooling decisions were made along the way to result in the most capable species on the planet, then we will know how to thrive as individuals today.
It’s astounding just how much we know about our early cultures, practices, diets, food processing, tooling and how we acquired our food.
Furthermore, the strong linkage we have established between an increase in nutrient density in our diets and the explosion in body size, brain volume, intelligence, social skills and proliferation is a compelling call to better respect the power of nutrition.
In this episode, Bill helps us understand the connection between the technology we developed, and our very existence! That without the food acquiring and processing tools we developed and harnessed, we simply would not be. This is powerful stuff!
 
This episode strongly makes the case to return to an ancestral-influenced diet, with evidence and logic that is hard to refute.
 
Check out the show notes for a full run down of what we cover. Enjoy! This will absolutely help you #BeYourBest.

Addicted to Sets Tennis Podcast,"This is a podcast for amateur tennis players like you. Each episode is a free audio tennis drill on a variety of topics to improve your game.  Teaching tennis pro Ryan Vega of Vega Tennis is co-host on the show sharing his tennis  expertise, while co-host Michelle Nipko asks all of the questions us club players want to know. Get addicted! Send your thoughts and prayers to Ryan.

Go Fund Me Page:

https://bit.ly/2NHn9qz ‘Addicted to Sets’ is a podcast covering the passions of tennis fans and players, co-hosted by avid tennis enthusiast Michelle Nipko and teaching pro Ryan Vega just outside of Austin, Texas.  In its most recent episode, the podcast features Cliff Drysdale, International Tennis Hall of Fame legend and the longest serving broadcaster at ESPN. 

Cliff began by talking about how his broadcasting career started during a Davis Cup match between USA and South Africa. Tony Trabert could not be the commentator for this match as he had been the captain of the USA Davis Cup team. Cliff was thus asked if he could take Trabert’s place as he was also from South Africa and knew the players. 

This was forty years ago, and Cliff could have never imagined it would be the start of a pivot in his career.  He went on to cover the US Open for CBS (“they thought it was awful!”). He was subsequently picked up by ESPN and WCT (“in those days, there was no cable”). Drysdale was on the job just one week after ESPN debuted for their first tennis telecast when Argentina took on USA at the 1979 Davis Cup in Memphis, Tennessee. 

Drysdale was one of the first players to introduce a two-handed backhand in professional competition. Though there were others, Drysdale counts himself as the first successful tennis player to have used this technique.   He shares another unique aspect of the 1960s tennis scene:  there were no coaches, masseurs, managers or psychologists. 

Among other topics, Cliff spoke about his experiences as the first ATP President, the recent bushfires in Australia, winners’ awards and prize moneys, the importance of big serves and muscle power in the game, Nick Kyrgios, the players to watch out for today in men’s and women’s tournaments, and more.

Parting advice from Cliff Drysdale: “Be yourself. Go with the flow. Like a tennis player needs to trust his or her swing.” Happy New Year!  Michelle and Ryan talk how to make changes to your game.  We all know it is difficult to change your body's muscle memory and sometime it takes taking one step backward to move forward.  Listen to this week's podcast as we discuss! Match preparation...and Merry Christmas from Michelle and Ryan! Ryan explains why footwork is one of the most important elements of your tennis game.  Listen to learn the best strategies for footwork in all parts of your game! Michelle and Ryan are on location at Lakecliff Racquet Club in the beautiful hill country in Spicewood Texas.  They discuss tennis ball pace and location strategy, among other things.  During the podcast they receive a text from tennis player and ESPN sports commentator Cliff Drysdale congratulating Michelle and other co-owners on the purchase of the new club.  Very Exciting! Sign up for the Podcast Drill Starting on December 21.   Link in show notes."

AF Canyon Run Against Cancer,"The AF Canyon Run Against Cancer Podcast is 13 interviews with inspiring people, describing their connection with an inspiring 13-mile race. The AF Canyon Run Against Cancer — powered by 97th Floor — is one of the most beautiful races in the state. It's also one of the greatest causes. Our goal is to help patients in our community who are fighting cancer, with 100% of race proceeds from the race benefitting cancer patients who cannot afford care. There's no such thing as an easy way to find out a loved one has cancer, but Lincoln and Lisa got a double blindside that feels especially brutal. ""She felt a little bump on her shoulder — smaller than a pea,"" Lincoln says, ""and she decided to go have it checked out. And the doctor that looked at her said, 'Well, the good news is that skin cancer is one of the most curable cancers there is.'""

As it turns out, though, this diagnosis was way off. Lincoln and Lisa's story is tragic, but beautifully told. In the Spring of 2015, Teresa was going through a heartbreaking divorce. Her brother thought what Teresa needed was to challenge herself. “You need something that's going to push you to your limits and really help you find that inner strength again.” 

Years later and having run multiplehalf marathons, Teresa thinks that Adam was right. And she’s paying that important insight forward in a big way. There's a lot of attention paid to the AFCRAC half-marathon, but it's time that the Kids' K — the 1K run for aspiring racers — get its due. 

It's a great episode with young racers Ty and Shawn, and contains some important reminders: running is fun, and getting a medal at the end is awesome. Chris Bennett would rather be surfing than running…but he's got good reasons to run the AF Canyon Run Against Cancer. (And only one of them is to beat his brother-in-law). For most of us, events like the AF Canyon Run Against Cancer are all about completingthe distance we choose. The victory comes in the form of crossing the finish line at all, or perhaps in finishing with a personal best.

There are a few people, however, for whom this is truly a race. Jane Durfey, a three-time podium finisher, is definitely one of these few.

Even so, however, that’s not why this is her favorite race. Not even close. No family wants to find whether they have the resilience and strength to catalyze loss into legacy.
 But that’s the challenge Jayci’s family has, and together — with their extended family — they gather each year at the AF Canyon Run Against Cancer. There, they run together and walk together, talk and listen together, and remember Jayci. 
 All while wearing very cool matching T-shirts."
Against the grain,"Conversations about fitness, health, performance and adventure. My second part of the deep dive into masculine archetypes and how I perceive them. Hopefully giving you an idea of the framework that we can use to understand masculine energy in both men and women. What does it mean to be a man in todays world? This episode is a deep dive into some of the things I have learnt about masculinity over the years, and how this relates to men and women.
I lean heavily on two of my favourite books, which both really helped me in hard times when I was questioning everything in my life. Bit dramatic lol, but digging into this stuff and trying to use what I learnt as a framework for being a better man was so important for me. Maybe you'll find this interesting?

Part 2 will be upcoming soon. A quick introduction to me and my podcast, why its against the grain and some initial musings on going against the grain in fitness and health!"
Age Groupies: A Podcast for Amateur Endurance Athletes,"Age Groupies: A Podcast for Amateur Endurance AthletesAge Groupies is a podcast dedicated to all things endurance sports from the amateur athletes’ perspective.

We also share tips and strategies when it comes to behavioral and activities of daily living management for dementia care with Latoya Galberth, Occupational Therapist and Owner of Galberth Health.

We also have a candid conversation with Scott Briggaman, host of the Triangle's Morning News, about his caregiving journey.

Alex Lemelin,"I am a 200 Hour Certified Yoga Teacher at True North Yoga in Kingman, Arizona.  I love to teach Restorative Yin and All Levels Vinyasa yoga classes.  I have been teaching for over 3 years and am excited to share through this podcast. Take 60 minutes to show yourself some love in a restorative way. This class is for all bodies with a message of self love and a few readings from the Dalai Lama. If you have blankets, bolsters, blocks, and straps you might want to bring them to this class. Allow yourself to let go for the next 60 minutes and relax. All levels vinyasa class, focusing on the energy we are all born with - vitality. Using the wall to facilitate balance and inversions, using the wall can make Yin more accessible for people with a variety of mobility ranges. This vinyasa class is a slower flow with some longer holds and powerful breath. All poses are on the floor. Yin yoga poses are held for 2 to 3 minutes allowing access to the connective tissues and giving you time to relax and restore.  It is about mindfulness and being with your breath with a small amount of movement.
In this episode you will explore full relaxation and stretching throughout your entire body,   I do a few readings out of Melody Bettie's book, Journey to the Heart, get yourself comfortable and let's get started. An all levels vinyasa flow class suited for beginners to seasoned practitioners."
Ali Fitness Podcast,"Achieve the fastest results with the most effective and up to date health and fitness strategies from our interviews with leading experts. Ali is a Primal Health and Fitness Coach in Asia. Ali Fitness brings you interviews aimed at bring health back into fitness. Naysayers often dismiss the Paleo lifestyle with the claim that it is simply a fad. But if you start at the beginning and explore what early humans were eating two million years ago, it becomes clear that the animal fat diet not only sustained our early ancestors but actually led to the development of our species. So if the Paleo movement is a fad, it’s a pretty persistent one! Today’s guest is no stranger to the pushback against the lifestyle, and he’s here to explain how the latest science and technology support his understanding of Paleo as the perfect human diet.
 CJ Hunt dropped dead at the age of 24. He was a dirt bike racer training to come back from an injury when he suffered full cardiac arrest while jogging. Paramedics resuscitated CJ, and he spent ten days in the ICU at UCLA Medical Center. Doctors eventually determined that he suffers from a birth defect in which the center of his heart is twice as thick as normal, and his left chamber is smaller. He was told that if he continued to exercise, he would be lucky to live for another two years.
 This experience inspired CJ’s curiosity in health and well-being, and ultimately led him to back to school at the age of 53 to earn a degree in Electronic Communications Arts from San Francisco State University so that he could produce the world’s first Paleo documentary, The Perfect Human Diet. The film reached #1 in the categories of Documentary Film and Independent Film on both iTunes USA and iTunes Canada when it was released in 2013. Together with its companion book, the movie introduces a system of optimal nutrition based on the latest science. Today CJ explains how nutrition has become so much like religion and politics, why public policy lags behind the best science, and the roots of the pushback against the Paleo/Primal movement. Listen in to understand the fundamentals of Paleo nutrition and why this two million-year-old ‘fad’ is making a comeback!
 Topics Covered [2:47] How CJ developed an interest in studying nutrition
  ‘Dropped dead’ at 24, given just a few years to live Began to study health and well-being  [3:57] The evolution of CJ’s eating habits

But the truth is, some of the best things you can do for your health cost nothing at all. On this episode of Ali Fitness, we hack the biohacker, picking the brain of a master to find out how to feel our best—without breaking the bank!
 Thaddeus Owen is a master biohacker and blogger with Primal Hacker and Eris Fit. He is also a certified Bulletproof Coach with a Master’s degree in Holistic Nutrition as well as a certified personal trainer. Thaddeus began his career as a chemical engineer, working for a traditional pharmaceutical company. Eventually, he left the corporate lifestyle for a work-from-home job as Chief Sustainability Engineer and Product Stewardship Manager for Herman Miller, identifying non-toxic products to use in furniture construction. He continues to work full-time while studying biohacking and sharing his knowledge of health, longevity and cognitive enhancement with the Primal Hacker audience.
 Today, Thaddeus shares his top three no-brainer biohacks: morning sunlight, sleep and clean water. He explains the impact of blue LED light on sleep and offers advice around the best lights for the bedroom and proven brands of blue light blocking glasses. Thaddeus walks us through the pros and cons of SARMs, smart drugs and nootropics, describing his experience testing Qualia for the Neurohacker Collective. Listen in for Thaddeus’ insight on how to research psychedelics and get his top advice for aspiring biohackers!

  Local meetup groups, university professors Resources by Dennis McKenna Private conversations at retreats, conferences Wish you could wake up without a cup of coffee? Or wind down at night without a glass of wine? Most of us spend the day self-medicating to manage our energy, using stimulants and sedatives to adjust our body’s rhythms. Rhythms thrown off by the activity-driven stress of modern life. But what if there was a wearable that could replicate the states of calm and balance we’re chasing and ultimately restore our body’s natural rhythms?
 Dr. David Rabin is the Cofounder and CIO at Apollo Neuroscience, a technology company developing the first scientifically-validated wearable to improve focus, sleep and meditative states by delivering layered vibrations to the skin. A board-certified psychiatrist and translational neuroscientist, Dr. Rabin spent the last decade studying the impact of chronic stress in humans and researching non-invasive therapies designed to improve quality of life in patients with treatment-resistant illnesses. He also led the world’s largest controlled study around the benefits of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy in mental disorders.
 On this episode of Ali Fitness, David joins us to explain how his work treating patients with PTSD, anxiety and substance abuse disorders led to the creation of the Apollo wearable. He walks us through what it looks and feels like to use the device on a given day, selecting from among its seven functional frequencies to wake up or wind down naturally. David also describes the science behind Apollo, discussing how it changes our biological rhythms, redirecting energy away from the body’s stress response system. Listen in to understand how elite athletes are using Apollo to adapt to stress and learn how the wearable could help you realize your true potential and feel your absolute best!
 Topics Covered [1:00] How Dr. Rabin came to develop the Apollo wearable

 The conventional approach to endurance training promotes ‘chronic cardio’ and carbohydrate dependency. But there is a way to reset your metabolic clock with the keto diet, and today’s guest wrote the book on it – well, he co-authored it anyway!
 Brad Kearns has been a well-known coach, speaker and author in the health and fitness realm for 20-plus years. During his nine-year career as a triathlete, he was one of the world’s top ranked professionals, amassing 30 wins worldwide on the pro circuit, and he still holds the Hawaii Ironman 18-24 age division American record at 8:57.
 Brad has partnered with his former coach and fellow health and fitness authority Mark Sisson to lead the Primal Blueprint, a comprehensive ancestral health movement. Together they co-authored the 2016 release Primal Endurance, a guidebook that teaches athletes how to employ a stress-balanced, fat-adapted Primal approach to training. The duo has another book coming out this fall, The Keto Reset Diet. Today Brad joins Ali to discuss the basics of MAF training and his take on the relationship between peak performance and long-term health. Listen and learn how to leverage the keto diet to become a fat-burning machine and get free from carbohydrate dependency!

  Overstress heart during workout Sustain small scarring on delicate ventricles, inflammation Leads to AFib  [44:56] Brad’s take on t For thousands and thousands of years, humans have consumed cannabis, leveraging its micronutrients to adapt to technological shifts. And then we abruptly pulled it out of our diets, just as our oxidative stress levels shot up. So, what can we do to counter this one-two punch to our collective health? How, exactly, do CBD and other compounds produced by the cannabis plant work to benefit our body systems? And what can we do to choose quality CBD products that actually work?
 Will Kleidon is the Founder and CEO of Ojai Energetics, an ethics-driven health and wellness company based in California. Ojai Energetics seeks to bring ancient healing products to life by way of modern innovation, and it leads the world in producing vital natural organic supplements with water-soluble CBD to promote everyday health and healing. Will is a subject matter expert in the art, science and technology of the cannabis business, and his work has been featured in Forbes, Money and Entrepreneur Magazine, among many other media outlets.
 On this episode of Ali Fitness, Will joins us to define CBD and explain the benefit of CBD-rich full spectrum complex over CBD in isolate. He speaks to the CBD product fillers we should avoid, describing what to look for in terms of third-party batch testing and certified organic ingredients. Will also shares how bioavailability differentiates Ojai Energetics products from others on the market and walks us through the laws around CBD in the US and abroad.

 Resources Dr. Raphael Mec ‘The best athletes on the teams I’ve worked with have always been the best sleepers. The bottom third of the sleepers are usually gone within a few years.’
 We live in a world where functioning on less and less sleep has become ‘the new normal,’ so we may not realize just how much insufficient sleep impacts our performance. Of course, there are elements of this that are out of our control, like the travel schedule associated with competition. But if you are struggling to get close to the recommended 7½-9 hours, it is likely that your reaction time and your ability to focus are suffering. What is the best way to monitor how much sleep you’re actually getting? And how do you determine what’s causing the problem if you’re falling short?
 Pat Byrne is an authority in the field of sleep science with 30-plus years of experience in health and safety, risk management, and performance optimization. Pat’s fatigue management systems utilize state-of-the-art technology to revolutionize the way professional sports teams and 24/7 workplaces manage sleep schedules to enhance performance and mitigate risk. Pat’s elite client roster includes the US Department of Defense, Harvard Medical School, major mining and transportation companies, and leading sports teams in the NHL, NFL, NBA, MLS, MLB and AFL.
 Today Pat gives us the run down on the importance of sleep, explaining the influence of age and biological variation on the amount an individual needs. He shares the short- and long-term consequences of sleep deprivation, his experience around the causes of sleep issues, and why sleep quality is more important than duration. Pat cautions us against using consumer-grade technology to monitor sleep and relying on sleeping pills to get the rest we need. Listen in as Pat speaks to the sleep challenges particular to athletes, discussing his approach to consulting with individuals and teams to improve performance.

All Day Ruckoff Podcast,"Brian, founder of All Day Ruckoff, talks about rucking, gear, fitness, and GORUCK with those in the community. After completing GORUCK Challenge Class 053 Brian started the website All Day Ruckoff to encourage and provide insight to others who wanted to take on the GORUCK Challenge. Years after the formation of All Day Ruckoff the All Day Ruckoff Podcast is born. Listen to interviews with athletes, event organizers, cadre, ruck clubs, GORUCK employees, and those who make this community special. Completing one GORUCK Heavy is an accomplishment. Completing back to back GORUCK Heavy events is a huge accomplishment. Completing three back to back to back Heavy events is insane. Nick Schrein joins me in this podcast episode to talk about the one Triple Heavy GORUCK event that has ever been completed.







Nick gets into his endurance background, his training, and what happened during the GORUCK Triple Heavy event. After talking with him it becomes apparent just how absolutely insane this event.

Thank you so much for all of the support! Subscribe through iTunes, Spotify, Google Podcasts, We’re in the days between Christmas 2019 and the start of 2020! In this episode I talk about how I set goals, goal setting in general, and tips for making your 2020 the best year possible.







Goal Setting 2020







* Write down (or find your list of) your 2019 goals.* Mark the goals you accomplished and the goals you didn’t accomplish.* Going through the goals you accomplished write why you were able accomplish them and what you did to accomplish them.* Going through the goals you didn’t accomplish write down why you didn’t accomplish them. Be honest so that you can use this as feedback for how to accomplish your goals in the future.* Write down two or three categories you want to focus on in 2020.* Within each category right down the goals that, if you completed, would help you improve that category.* Write down ways you can accomplish each individual goal.* Write down things that could prevent you from completing those goals.* Based on what could help you accomplish each individual goal start planning your year out high-level. Get an idea of what your calendar will look like to make sure it’s possible to complete.

Correggere uno squat... come fare. L'allenamento con i pesi e le ragazze. 
Quando si tratta di allenamento declinato al femminile bisogna dare attenzione ad aspetti che spesso vengono trascurati.

"Ancient Wisdom, Modern Health","Here I share and explain how to get and stay healthy with Tai Chi, Qigong, and Kung Fu. Mixing interviews with incredible people, and my own insights and experiences, we look for timeless wisdom and proven practices to be healthy and happy today. The term ""Kung Fu"" has become a popular term that denotes classical combat oriented Kung Fu. However, there is a depth to its meaning that goes far further. In this episode I describe I and my peers with decades of experience refer to when we say ""Kung Fu"". In part two of this discussion I address unlocking your genius and the greatest challenge to building your own Kung Fu. In this episode, I describe the history of the Chin Woo association that preserved and modernized many classical martial arts and its founder Huo Yuan Jia. My teacher Wong Jackman ran the San Francisco Chin Woo where he taught in tune with the philosophy of the Chin Woo association. 
This is the official Chin Woo website: http://chinwoo.com/ In this episode I answer questions regarding protecting your Qi while practicing classical Gong Fu like Northern Shaolin, Lan Shou Quan or Pao Chui. I also discuss healing emotional traumas and mental heath with Tai Chi and Qi Gong based on my decades of teaching. In this episode I tell two stories, discuss our goals to help you, our students and friends, look a little at the Tai Chi philosophy of Yin and Yang, and we have a special surprise for a our local students at the very end! 

We wish you Happy New Year of 2020 filled with great moments and love with your family and friends, good health, and success! In this episode I share a gift with you for the Holidays. This ""Secret"" gift is the verbal instructions on Post Standing Qigong, a wonderful, healing, breathing exercise and meditation, I frequently practice and teach. I use these instructions to lead this exercise in class, and teach my students to perform at home. No you can tune in this podcast and practice along when you have a good place and a free moment. This exercise is perfect for total beginners. It is also a great place to begin if you are recovering from an injury or illness. Post Standing can also help if you are subject to the stress and tension so common in our modern world. Post Standing Qigong requires a minimum amount of space and no equipment. You can practice this Qigong as long as you wish. It is truly a simple and safe method that yields great results. Not quick results but slow drop by drop results that add up gradually to deep change. The instructions given in this podcast will help you to establish a good practice method. You can practice as long as you desire and you have enough strength. I encourage you to listen to my previous episodes about qigong. See the show notes for details and links to cool new classes! In this episode we look at the meaning and nature of Tai Chi Chuan in relationship to Qigong and classical combat oriented Gung Fu like Northern Shaolin, Lan Shou Quan, Ba Gua Zhang, and Hung Gar.I also discuss the reality of learning Tai Chi Chuan as a martial art and what it takes to become skillful in the martial side of Tai Chi, in addition to the healing meditative side of Tai Chi. In today's world many people are asking questions regarding the validity of Tai Chi as a martial art and questioning whether you can become a powerful fighter using only Tai Chi. In this episode I share my opinions in regard to this important question."

Alyssa found her way to herbalism by way of organic farming, realizing that she was as interested in what the “weeds” were up to as the crops she was supposed to be cultivating! While teaching hands-on garden education at Jones Valley Teaching Farm, she fed her profound love of science, plants and cooking by connecting Birmingham City School students to food, farming, and the culinary arts through standards-based lessons and after-school programs. If plants were her second love, languages were her first.

She is deeply invested in working with clients to build a preventative, compassionate model of care that addresses the root causes of illness and discomfort in an effective and comprehensive way.

Dr. Conley is the owner and operator of Total Health Solutions in Colorado.  She also is the founder of Gait Happens.  Her personal journey of becoming a foot and gait expert began years ago when she attended chiropractic school in Chicago, Illinois.  She was fortunate enough to study under the top experts in her field.  This began a long journey of working in several orthotic labs, wearing orthotics herself for years, and realizing that something was a miss as she was in constant pain chasing symptoms. 

She was a triathlete suffering from chronic foot, knee, and low back pain.  After years of altering orthotics, and changing footwear, she realized that simply bracing the foot was not the answer. Always struggling with the concept:   Why are we telling our patients with foot pain to brace the foot with an orthotic for years at a time when we would never tell our patients with low back pain to wear a back brace for years at a time. 

As a result, Dr. Conley went down the slow, and often frustrating journey of eliminating her orthotics and transitioning into the 'barefoot' world.  She began assessing and treating her foot, like she did every where else in her body, with the goal of moving better and functioning more efficiently.  And she succeeded.  

Now with the desire to share this with her patients, Dr. Conley dove deeply into educating herself on barefoot function and learning from experts such as Steven Sashen, the CEO of XERO shoes, and Sebastian Bar, the owner of Joe Nimble; the creators of 2 functional footwear companies.  She studied more on the mechanics of the foot and its relationship to the entire kinetic chain. 

Today, Dr. Conley is on the forefront of educating the public on the benefits of foot health.   It is her passion and desire to see people eliminate foot pain and begin moving better, eliminating unnecessary procedures and chronic pain.  She is enjoying consulting with clients all over the world as well as teaching her lower extremity course, TOP DOWN, BOTTOM UP, with her best friend and partner, Dr. Joseph LaVacca.  

You can find where Dr. Conley is teaching both for Rocktape as well as Top Down Bottom Up on the courses tab.

As you can imagine we discuss all things pertaining to gait, movement, running, footwear and so much more!"

Art Beauty,"Welcome to the Art Beauty podcast. A weekly escape that provides amusing anecdotes, practical tips and insightful interviews with top experts and influencers. Hosted by veteran reporter and beauty junkie, Amber Milt, and hair guru and reality star, Ryan Nickulas, this podcast explores the wonderful and wacky world of skincare regimens and rituals, plastic surgery breakthroughs and busts, and how to reinvent yourself one eyelash at a time.  From the products that make them swoon to the procedures that made them swell, discover how these beauty-besties have navigated the often confusing but always fun universe of makeup, makeovers, and more. New episodes air every Tuesday. We want to hear from you - tell us your beauty tips and tricks and ask the questions you want answered:Instagram: @artbeautypodcastFacebook: @artbeautypodcastTwitter: @artbeautypodcas (no “t”)Email: ArtBeautyPodcast@gmail.comAmber Milt @ambermiltRyan Nickulas @ryannickulas Our guest, Emily Joy, is a microblading expert who received brow shaping and artistry training with the legendary celebrity eyebrow artist Anastasia Soare (Anastasia of Beverly Hills). 
 
Emily is now the founder of Dollistic (dollistic.com), an exclusive atelier specializing in luxury micropigmentation, paramedical tattooing, and advanced permanent makeup trainings. 
She talks to us about how to achieve a hyperrealistic aesthetic when it comes to permanent makeup and the essential safety questions you must ask your technician. Whether you’re interested in microblading your brows, adding color to your pout with lip blushing, or scalp tinting, she’ll discuss the considerations for selecting the right color and the skincare products and lifestyle choices that can affect how your color fades.
 
In this episode we’ll cover:

*  How to pick a technician and the essential safety questions to ask for – all states differ on the requirements.
* The skincare products and lifestyle choices that can affect how your brow color fades.

  After being diagnosed with psoriasis, one of our listeners wrote to us asking if we could explore some non-pharmaceutical treatments for their skin condition. Since we know that psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease, characterized by an accelerated cycle of skin cell growth, we wanted to see if there was any evidence to support CBD as a method of relief.
We went to Mello founder (mellodaily.com), Boronia Fallshaw, to break down how cannabinoids anti-inflammatory powers may help relieve psoriasis and eczema symptoms.  She'll also share how to determine the proper dosing, and her favorite way to take it – no, it's not under the tongue (think much, much lower on the body). Hilary Loftus, trainer at Liftonic (liftonic. com), left the ""skinny"" world of fashion, for a fitter life and body.  Her transformation proves that with hard work, you can transform your body without surgery.  She shares her secret to building the butt you really want this year. Ryan teaches Amber how to cover her gray hair with a temporary dye - all live on air! And we didn’t forget the guys - Ryan demonstrates how to dye your hair, brows and beard - in only 5 minutes. He’ll share tips for getting the best coverage and the secret trick to remove dye from your skin. If you look in the toolkit of any professional makeup artist, YouTube beauty expert, or budding makeup enthusiast, you’re probably going to find a Beautyblender (https://beautyblender.com/).  It’s the hot-pink, egg-shaped sponge that transformed makeup application in an HD world.  And, according to Beautyblender’s CEO, Rea Ann Silva, most of us are using it wrong.
We talk to the founder and creator of the world’s most popular makeup sponge about everything from how she came up with the egg-shaped sponge, to the proper way to use it.  She even has a thing or two to say about those who claim that your Beautyblender can kill you.  Learn how this beauty mogul and true boss babe manages the empire behind one of the best-selling beauty tools of all time. More than 50% of women will experience noticeable hair loss in their lives. But one woman has dedicated her life and career to proving that bald really is beautiful.  We sit down with author and filmmaker, Alyscia Cunningham, to talk about ""I Am More Than My Hair,"" (https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/i-am-more-than-my-hair#/) a book and documentary film that redefines the beauty of female baldness and captures the stories of girls and women who’ve lost their hair due to medical conditions or by choice to support a loved one."

Vous allez entendre à mon micro aujourd’hui Geneviève Guérard, co-fondatrice du studio Wanderlust à Montréal. Son parcours est tout ce qu’il y a de plus inspirant, tant par la persévérance dont elle a su faire preuve en tant que danseuse professionnelle, que par le courage qu’il lui a fallu pour se réorienter vers le journalisme puis le yoga. 

J’ai rencontré Geneviève en Mai alors que je repérais mon futur appartement Canadien, et c’est en Novembre que j’ai eu le plaisir d’enregistrer cet épisode dans son studio du Mile End.

Balance and Activate Your Fertility,"Welcome to the Balance and Activate Your Fertility Podcast. This is the place to find hope again, to believe in your ability to conceive no matter WHAT you’ve tried before, to find the knowledge and guidance you’re looking for to take control of your health and restore your fertility, and to understand that you’re NOT alone...you are part of a community of like-minded women who are determined to be the healthiest versions of themselves so they can get pregnant, stay pregnant and hold finally their healthy bouncing babies in their arms. You are on this journey together with others who’ve got your back, sister! Like me, your host, Heidi Brockmyre, licensed doctor of Chinese medicine, fertility acupuncturist and founder of the Fertility Activation Method, my proven online program that gives women step-by-step daily instructions to prepare their bodies for pregnancy so they can finally have their healthy babies. Are you ready? Let’s do this! Today, I want to talk about something that absolutely breaks my heart.

If you've been given this speech by your doctor that you need to use an egg donor, you know exactly how devastating this feels.

Please listen to this podcast to learn what you can do now. ""Do I need to think positive to get pregnant?""

I have many women that are worried that if they don't think positive, then they won't end up pregnant.

Listen to this podcast for my thoughts. What do you think? ""How long should I wait to try to conceive after a miscarriage?""

Listen to this podcast to learn more about this question.  Listen to this episode for some of my thoughts as to why your IVF failed. Our diet is important and our ability to absorb the nutrition is equally important.

Diet is the foundation of our health. Often times we find it to be very complicated, but this episode gives you some basic guidelines. The body is resilient and wants to be healthy and fertile, even after failed fertility treatments, even over 40 - it doesn’t care how old it is!

BUT, you need to give your body the right support. It’s so important.

I’ve seen women time and time again take the right steps to reset their fertility and get pregnant, even after trying for several years, miscarrying, etc.

Resetting your fertility involves a few different steps. They’re simple, but do require commitment, consistency and patience."

   Todd Schweb is an active member of the Canadian kettlebell sport contingent, who has represented Canada on the World stage several times.
 Todd will be heading to Ireland for the WKSF World Kettlebell Sport Championships 2019, Meath, Ireland from May 23-26.
 5 months ago Todd and Lorraine opened a gym in Armstrong, BC - and on August 10th they will hold the Inaugural North Okanagan Kettlebell Open as part of the IKO World League Series. Nikolai was kind and candid enough with us to share his experience with how he started lifting weights, and how he found kettlebells as a way to rehab some old injuries and regain his strength, and finally how he was able to recruit a legion of followers who praise the many benefits of kettlebell sport.
  
 Don't forget about Nikolai's upcoming competition on December 1st, to be held at Seattle Kettlebell Club Headquarters.

Bar(bell) Talk,Get swole What are SARMs? Should you use them. Probably not but let's talk about using them anyways.
Barbell Logic,"Matt Reynolds and Scott Hambrick discuss all things strength. Follow the podcast @barbell_logic on instagram and join the Facebook group at https://www.facebook.com/barbelllogiccoaching. Contact Matt at www.barbell-logic.com @reynoldsstrong on IG, Twitter and Facebook. Contact Scott at www.barbell-logic.com @scott_silverstrength on IG. In part 3 of the MED Masterclass series, Matt walks through the transition from an HLM or Texas Method style program to his favorite program, the four-day split. Every man dies, but not every man really lives. Count Professor Paul among the living. After a long, difficult battle with cancer in his neck, Paul Markel has emerged victorious and we are happy to welcome him back to the podcast. In the second masterclass on Minimum Effective Dose (MED) programming, Matt discusses the three principles or ""rules"" of MED, and offers specific examples of post-novice programming for the squat, deadlift, bench and press. Matt and Scott are back with another round of Thursday Q&amp;A. If you'd like to ask Matt and Scott a question, email questions@barbell-logic.com and we'll feature you on a future Q&amp;A episode! In the MED masterclass, you'll get to sit in the coach's seat and learn how to think more deeply about programming, identify problems, and formulate solutions based on logic and analysis -- not just looking at templates. Longtime strength coach and now PhD Neuroscience student Jayson Ball joins the show today to talk about his work in the world of pain neuroscience. Pain is a perplexing thing. While many people understand it as a strictly mechanical phenomenon (you slam your fingers in a door and say ""ouch!""), pain also has a complex emotional and neurological component that cannot be ignored."
Barbells &amp; Brothers with Troy Ismir,"The Barbells & Brothers podcast is for men who want to live an inspired life of purpose for the glory of God and the good of others.  This show will help men overcome: Isolation and lonelinessPoor physical, mental and spiritual healthLack of PurposeOur focus will be on what it means to be in brotherhood, how to live a life of optimal health and live a life of purpose. In this last podcast of 2019 I talk about my one word for 2020, COURAGE.  We will explore what it means to be courageously vulnerable and I will challenge you to come up with your own one word.  
 I will also talk about the re-branding of the Spiritual Warriors Unite podcast into the Barbell and Brothers podcast.  You can learn more here.  https://www.barbellsandbrothers.com/ With the holidays and the New Year coming up I thought this would be a good time to release a compilation of five of my top interviews for nutrition and weight loss.  This podcast contains several experts that I have interviewed over the years.  Give a listen for some inspiration, encouragement and knowledge to make some transformational changes for 2020.   This is a compilation of five of my top interviews for nutrition and weight loss.  My guest today on the Spiritual Warriors Unite podcast is  Julio Anta.  Julio owns Anta's Fitness and Self Defense, one of South Florida's most successful and recognized martial arts and fitness centers.  Julio is a martial arts and fitness instructor and also is an international competitive bodybuilder.   Julio's scripture of choice was Habakkuk 2:2-3.  ""Write down the revelation and make it plain on tablets so that a herald may run with it.  For the revelation awaits an appointed time; it speaks of the end and will not prove false.  Though it linger, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay.""   God designed men to conquer.   We need challenges in our lives.   If we don’t have challenges we get soft and bored and that is never a good combination.   Revelation 3:21 states, “The one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.”
 I believe one of the biggest battles I see men face is one of complacency.  Not living life to the full, both in our spiritual walk and our physical being.  We have gotten soft physically, mentally and spiritually. 
 In this episode of the Spiritual Warriors Unite podcast you will learn about why having a BHAG is important and how to set a BHAG that excites and scares you.   If you are like me you ask yourself this question all of the time, ""Can I really make a difference in this world?""  Listen to this podcast to hear my story of how the journey to impacting one million men's lives starts with one.   "

We dive deep on their journeys and where strength training has taken them. World record holders share their competition secrets. Coaches give their most underrated tips.

This podcast is the perfect companion for experts and beginners alike, covering a wide range of topics to keep listeners up to date on the world of strength. In the world of fitness, Rich Froning needs almost no introduction. He is a 4-time Individual and 4-time Team CrossFit Games Champion, as well as the owner of CrossFit Mayhem in Cookeville, Tennessee.

Please share this podcast and our mission with all of your friends! We can't do any of it without you. Just because it fits your macros doesn't mean it's healthy for you and just because you're eating a small portion doesn't mean that you're going to lose weight. We dive into all things food and nutrition this week. We've had a lot going on for a while, but we're back to hang out with you guys! Hang out with us as we talk all about our lives and tips for staying healthy through the holidays. Our lives were turned upside down this year and we have been thrown a lot of curves. With everything going on we learned what burn out really is and what it means. We all go through it so what do you do and how do you handle it? We give you our story and then go through some options of how to deal with it. We are Amanda and Ty and we want to introduce ourselves and help you get to know us and who we are!"

Beginner Runner Village,"Sensible Training, Satisfying Results Yes, I’m back. I know, you probably thought you’d never hear another episode, but surprise, I’ve just finished three, and I have plans for at least another nine. After the main topic of this podcast, the documentary film I helped to make, I’ll explain more about the future of this podcast. It’s in your hands.

I’ve been talking about the Human Race running documentary for years, now, but it has finally happened. The film premiered in LA in June and soon, you’ll all have an opportunity to see it. We’re hoping for a premiere in the Tampa Bay area in December and worldwide distribution is set for January.  This is it! You’ve been learning about what to do for nine days. Think of this as graduation day, the day you get the last, but most critical, piece of the puzzle. Today, you find out exactly what you should do, and I mean you, personally, should do on Day 1 of your running journey. Today, is you diagnostic run.

In this podcast, I explain what to do to find out how far you should run during each running segment of your walk to run mile, which is the distance you should start with. 

I also explain how to progress from there, the three variables, and the details regarding the decisions you’ll be making in deciding what to change and when. 

I’m excited for you because this is, of all the secrets I’ve imparted, perhaps the most crucial one, because if you try to start your running training with too much, you’ll likely never succeefd I’ve been hearing the phrase, ‘turtle power,’ for years, always from ‘slower’ runners, usually in an upbeat, positive way, an “I’m fine with that” way, but sometimes they utter the words apologetically, and that makes me sad.

Often, these are beginner runners, but not always. It is my hope that after listening to this podcast, no one listening will ever feel bad, in any way, about being a slower runner. What is slow, anyway? It’s all relative, isn’t it? When an Olympian runs a 6 minute mile, it’s an off day. Most runners will never see the faster side of 9 minutes, and some will always run 12 minute miles, and I sure hope those people don’t apologize for that because there is no reason to be the least bit apologetic. To me, that’s like apologizing because you have brown hair.

If anyone ever makes you feel like your pace is too slow, then that person is just being unkind and isn’t worth worrying about. You have as much right to go your own pace and be happy with it as any other runner has a right to go the pace that is comfortable to them.

After all, running is an individual sport. One of the most enjoyable elements of running is that anyone can do it; you don’t need to be a gifted athlete, but I sure hope you do realize that anyone at any pace is an athlete.

Turtle Power is the mantra of slower runners everywhere, and so it should be. I hope it’s empowering. If you’re a slower runner, and since you’re a beginner, you probably are, own it; don’t apologize for it. Turtle runners unite!

Subscribe with Stitcher Radio Weight loss or management plays a role in the life of virtually every runner. Either they start running to lose weight or they’ve alreaady lost weight, and the want to become a runner to help them maintain that weight loss or they’re worried that their weight will gradually creep up if they don’t get lots of exercise.

Even the most fit-looking, slender runners will often say that maintaining a desirable weight is one of the reasons why they run.

Bottom line, many runners are running to lose weight.

It works. Running can, without a doubt, facilitate these goals, but for some, it doesn’t work. It’s not a given that you’ll lose weight by starting to run. Some people become runners and never lose weight, or even gain weight. I’ve seen it enough times that, now, I can explain why that happens and how to avoid it.

I’ve got some guidelines for nutrition as well. I want you to succeed in reaching your weight loss goals, and I’m sure this information will help you do that.

Subscribe with Stitcher Radio The two main reasons why beginner runners don’t succeed are these:



* They get injured and conclude their bodies can’t handle it.

* They don’t enjoy running; they may even dread the workouts.





When you do it the way I’ve set out in this series, there is no doubt but that you’ll feel good during and after the workouts, mentally and physically. That’s a given, but I’m sure you’re wanting to know what you can do to run healthy and prevent running injuries. That is the topic of this episode.

Subscribe with Stitcher Radio Many beginner runners don’t warm-up because they think the only reason to warm-up is to prepare to run fast; they know they don’t run fast, so they skip the warm-up. That is a big mistake, but I absolutely understand how a beginner runner might arrive at the conclusion that, for them, a warm-up is unnecessary.

The fact is that warming up is even more critical for the beginner runner than it is for an advanced runner. I’ll explain that and how to do an appropriate beginner runner warm-up in this podcast.

Then, we’ll talk about walking paces. By that I mean paces for the three different occasions when a beginner runner walks as part of a weekly schedule. Those three are the speed for walking when walking is the whole workout on your easier, non walk/run days, walking as part of a warm-up before the walk run interval, and last, the pace for walking between running intervals. This question came up several times in my online coaching group; so, I know it’s one that occurs to most people executing a walk to run program.

 Visionary Performance Welcome to another episode of Behind the Vision Podcast with your host Dustin Chau!
 One problem that many of us face is the lack of motivation...
 We all know what it feels like when we get that motivation high and we want to crush s**t and get after our goals. However, we also know what it feels like when that feeling goes away and we find ourselves back to where we were in the first place and it sucks!
 In this episode, I talk about how the constant search for motivation is the culprit to why we can't achieve our goals. Rather we should focus on taking one little step at a time which builds good habits and consistency.

Tom (the shows co-host) discusses protein off the back of a popular TV program “Trust me I’m a Doctor” – obviously not an expert on protein though. Tom explores protein, how it stimulates muscle protein synthesis, bioavailability scoring, beginners and experienced lifters muscle growth rates, why you might supplement with it, who elevated protein is good for, and other protein and bad science musings.

Grab a copy of Ragan’s book here: https://amzn.to/2u37f2L So when I was younger I apparently had ADHD, and was sensitive to bright light (which tbf I still am, love a dim room lit by a fire, the bright light of a squash court freaks me out). So I get asked a lot about what I did to solve my ADHD and for me that had to be tied into a bigger conversation around diet, procrastination, social media and why we do the things we do. I'm just one guy with one experience, so take from this podcast what you wish, but I think, whether you feel you suffer with ADHD, poor concentration or motivation, this podcast will give you some perspective. Intermittent Fasting has been around for AGES, I’ve done it off and on, and when I did first do it there was next level broscience around what it was and what it did. In this Podcast Tom and I delve into the science, its limitations, where it has benefits, where people have lied on its benefits and where the truth lies, and how you can start to apply it in your life, and importantly, why. This show got deep quick, so stay prepped for part 2 in two weeks time.

Berry Podcast,"Negli episodi di Berry Podcast parleremo di crescita personale e di come migliorare il tuo stile di vita attraverso l'allenamento, l'alimentazione. la gestione dell'emotività e delle abitudini. Per raggiungere un obiettivo non basta essere ispirati,desiderare. Bisogna avere una visione chiara e una strategia da attuare in modo da poter prevedere, gestire e superare gli ostacoli. Avere un obiettivo chiaro e una strategia realistica sono i primi passi. Ti spiego come fare! A tutti sono capitati momenti di incertezza. Quando hai uno stallo durante la dieta, quando studi per un esame ma non sai se cosa ti chiederanno, quando ti prepari a una gara e non conosci i tuoi avversari o come saranno realmente le tue condizioni quel giorno. Come si fa a superare le incertezze? Come possiamo andare avanti se non sappiamo se ne vale la pena? In 6 minuti ti racconto un piccolo aneddoto che forse ti aiuterà a capirci qualcosa... ""E' vero, ci sono i perenni insoddisfatti, quelli ""vorrei ma non posso"", quelli ""le ho provate veramente tutte""...e poi le avevano provate veramente tutte...per 5 minuti ognuna! Ma ci sono anche persone che sono propositive, vogliono un cambiamento, lo vogliono davvero, ma hanno difficoltà a trovare la propria strada quando si tratta di allenamento. 

Un po' perché sembra che per cambiare il proprio corpo sia necessario per forza chiudersi in sala pesi, a volte perché il contesto non è molto fertile e qualsiasi sport che non sia la classica sala pesi, i corsi, la corsetta sul tapis roulant o acquagym o zumba diventa motivo di sgomento e allora:

..se fai Crossfit ""diventi enorme""

..se fai pole dance ""sei una spogliarellista""

..se fai spartan Race ""sei matta, mica devi entrare nell'esercito!""

..se fai discipline aeree, arrampicata o qualsiasi cosa che implichi il fatto di stare a più di 10 centimetri da terra ""E SE CADI??? E MUORI!!!""

..se fai powerlifting ""sei un uomo""

e l'elenco potrebbe continuare.



Oggi ti voglio far capire che il tuo corpo può cambiare anche senza sala pesi e che le opportunità sono tante perché ricorda sempre: la COSTANZA è più importante della perfezione o della coerenza con un programma specifico e se non ti piace quello che fai, prima o poi smetterai di farlo!"

As sweat drips down your face and clothes stick in various places, it's a lot easier to throw in the towel and accept defeat, instead of sticking to your routine and beating the heat. To keep from melting away this summer, overcome the intense hot sun with a consistent fitness routine that is active, cool and fun. 
Say Hello to Hydration
Drinking enough water throughout the year is an important component for everyone's lifestyle. But when temperatures climb in the hot summer months and you are active outdoors, consistently drinking enough water is even more critical to maintaining your health and safety.
Hydration before a workout in the heat is really important. And the more you perspire during your workout the more water you need to drink.  Drink eight to 12 ounces of water before you work out in the heat and then consistently throughout the workout. Drink a glass of water as soon as you wake up in the morning. You've just had six to eight hours of having no water in your system so it’s important to replenish your water supply first thing in the morning.
While drinking an adequate amount of water is an important factor when exercising outside in the summer, it's also important to keep tabs on other elements that can contribute to heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Some of these additional contributing factors include body size, exercise intensity, fitness level, age, humidity and air temperature.
You can get twice the effect working out in the heat than when you are inside. You can work out for a shorter amount of time and reap the same rewards as long as you monitor hydration and watch for the warning signs of heat exhaustion.
Working out in the heat does provide some elements of danger, so take extreme care if you feel dizziness, headache or begin to feel faint, as these are all common signs of heat exhaustion.
Hit the Pool to Stay Cool
Summertime equals swimming time for most kids and families, but taking your workouts to the pool can also be a great way to stay cool while being active this summer. Swimming laps is a great total body cardio and resistance training workout, but you don't have to be a strong swimmer to benefit from exercising in the water. A good non-swimming pool workout  is simply running or walking back and forth in the shallow end of the pool as many times as you can in a set amount of time to get a high-intensity but low impact workout. Alternating between treading water and resting in the deep end of the pool for a set number of one-minute intervals also can be an effective summertime workout. The power of water as a built-in resistance tool can allow you to burn a maximum amount of calories in a relatively short amount of time.
Head Indoors for a Healthy Exercise Environment
If grueling hot temperatures are weighing you down and keeping you from getting in your outdoor workouts, take your exercise routine inside for a more stable and consistent environment. Working out indoors can help protect you from the outdoor elements of the summer season and allow you to focus more on getting in a good workout, and less on how hot you are. It also can provide a good opportunity to try out new equipment, small group classes or exercises that you commonly may not do in an outdoor environment.
In your journey for health, discipline is one of the best things you can do for yourself. When it comes to beating the heat, don't let hot temperatures be an excuse and don’t let them stop you from getting your workout in. Once the ""excuse cycle"" begins, workouts fall by the wayside, only for us to look up down the line with regret. Whether you work out inside or outdoors, the most important thing this is to keep your exercises fun and challenging, while maintaining co http://fitnesstogether.com/missionhills -- The total package of living a healthy lifestyle not only includes being physically fit, but also mentally strong. The same energy and attention you put into building your body's strength, endurance and flexibility should also be applied to having a positive attitude and perspective on life. It takes combining mental and physical strength with solid nutrition habits to build a body and brain that can successfully work together to accomplish your life's goals.
Mind Over Matter
Living a well-balanced healthy lifestyle starts with focusing on your mental, physical and nutritional health during your daily life activities. If you are not 100 percent on your nutrition, training and attitude, one or all of those is bound to suffer. Your attitude in the weight room, on the elliptical or while using the battle rope has to stay with you while you are on the construction site, taking care of the kids or sitting in your office.
One of the first steps to obtaining a strong body and healthy mind is to have solid, attainable goals before beginning the journey of health and fitness. Without a goal, or at least a vision in mind, you will most likely end up spinning your wheels or finding yourself working toward the impossible. Set your sights high, but be aware of the fine line between being realistic and completely impractical.
An example of a realistic and challenging goal might be to add 20 pushups to your existing maximum set of 15 within eight weeks. This type of approach gives you a clear-cut goal that can be broken down into smaller increments, making the challenge both mentally and physically achievable. Setting goals this way is much easier to manage and keep track of, and, make little tweaks along the way. Strength of the mind and the body will follow.
Active Lifestyles Breed Healthy Habits
Proper nutrition and exercise go hand in hand for achieving mental and physical health. While illness, stress, depression and other outside influences can take their toll on mental and physical health, each of these conditions has been shown to be diminished with the right diet and exercise plan.
While there is no one right way to train or eat, and while not every diet or program works for everyone, the two must be combined and work synergistically for the best possible outcome. The hormonal response the body puts out when undergoing these activities has been proven by science time and time again to illicit happy thoughts and less stress.
To accomplish total body health and fitness, it's important to incorporate strength training, cardio and mobility into your fitness regimen. A consistent cardio routine is key to keeping the heart healthy, enhancing your body's recovery and improving longevity, while lifting weights is an integral component to building strength, burning calories and accelerating fat loss. Weight training builds lean muscle, which in turn burns more calories because your body must use energy to build and maintain your muscles. More calories burned can lead to an increase in fat loss, making for a healthier and happier you.
Eat Well to Be Fit
When people think about eating healthy, the first thing that often comes to mind is reducing what they eat and taking away certain foods. Many people skip meals in an effort to lose weight and become more fit. This is not the answer, as you have to focus first, on simply eating to establish a healthy nutrition plan, which is all about portions size, frequency and quality of calories in. While you may lose weight (by skipping meals), you are in no way getting more fit. You are not building or retaining lean muscle. You are not recovering from your workouts. You are not getting vitamins and minerals. You are not feeding your brain. You are not going to keep your hormones in check and you are simply not feeding your body the raw energy (calories) it need http://www.fitnesstogether.com/missionhills
January in July: Re-Commit to Your Resolutions this Summer 
Do you make health and fitness resolutions to start out the New Year, but end up abandoning them before the first summer heat wave? Are you having a difficult time living a healthy and fit lifestyle this summer with the lure of outdoor barbecues and poolside parties?
Have no fear – resolutions aren’t just for the start of the New Year any more.
Now that you have hit the mid-point of the year, July is the perfect time to re-align your health and fitness goals. Close out the second half stretch strong and feeling great with the following tips to re-commit to your resolutions and incorporate fitness into your daily activities.
Set Real Resolutions for Real Results
One of the biggest obstacles for staying on track and achieving your resolutions is setting realistic goals that focus on long-term health and fitness results. Short-term goals of losing a certain amount of weight in only a few days or weeks is not only potentially dangerous, but can set you into a vicious start/stop workout cycle. Instead, break out your long-term fitness goals into short-range achievements that you can realistically accomplish. This approach will leave you feeling motivated and focused as you progress toward your ultimate fitness goals.
People generally set unrealistic goals.  So when they don’t achieve losing “100 pounds in six months”, they feel like a failure. Try to be realistic, taking into account the time you have available, work and family commitments and how committed you are to sticking to the nutrition side of the program.
The biggest battle is good nutrition, which means sticking with real, unprocessed whole foods. You shouldn’t have to be a rocket scientist to understand food labels. If you don’t know what the ingredients are on a food label, put it back on the shelf and move on to healthier options. Keep it simple and keep it real to stick with your health and fitness resolutions. Portion size, frequency and quality are key.
Carve Out Time for Fun Fitness Activities On the Road and At Home
Summer is a great time to take a break with a relaxing vacation. But that doesn’t mean you should vacate from a consistent exercise program. Do at least 30 minutes of exercise every day. The 30-minute sessions should include aerobic exercise to work the heart and lungs as well as resistance exercises on alternate days to strengthen your core, tighten your stability and improve balance. If you’re unable to commit to a full 30 minutes, break it up into 10-minute sessions throughout your busy day.
In a short 10 minutes, you can do some pushups, squats and some walking lunges. No matter where you are on vacation, have a resistance band in your suitcase and either walk or run. On alternate days, do bodyweight exercises for 30 minutes. Not much time taken out of your day. Most resorts have posh fitness facilities and great staffs; check it out.
When you’re at home, the summer may make you feel lazy. But it actually is the perfect time to be active outdoors with your friends and family. Whether you prefer a solo early morning walk, run, bicycle ride or swim before temperatures heat up or an evening bike ride and sunset walk with your family, it’s easier to find time to work out if you schedule it before or after the busy part of your day. As summer turns to fall, you may need to adjust your workout schedule to align with your family’s back-to-school commitments.  Just make sure that working out and staying fit is a top priority for you and your family.
Find Something You Love and Someone You Love to be Around
If you are struggling with taking the first step to an active lifestyle, start out simple by finding an active outlet that you enjoy doing.  If you can grab a partner in fitness to share the experience, that’s even b(c http://www.fitnesstogether.com/missionhills
STAY GREEN WITH AN ACTIVE FITNESS ROUTINE
While tree leaves and backyard lawns are well known for appearing in shades of glorious green colors this time of year, you also can bring some green to your fitness routine as you embark on living a healthy and fit lifestyle this spring. Summer is the perfect time to focus on the Three R’s of the environment by incorporating the following green tips into your active fitness routine.
Reduce:  While the common attitude in today’s culture is, “more is better,” the health and vitality of the planet relies on fewer toxins in the air for the betterment of the world and the people who live in it.  You can not only improve the health of Mother Earth but also your fitness level by focusing this spring on reducing the car exhaust and emissions that escape from your vehicle and household into the atmosphere. You can reduce your family’s carbon footprint by riding your bike to run errands, drop off/pick up your kids from school and perform any other transportation duties around your neighborhood. You also can reduce the electricity you use to work out by trading in the electrically powered treadmill for an outdoor track or running/walking path.
Reuse: The past generations of our grandparents and great-grandparents lived in a time when reusing everything was more of a norm than it is today. You can get back to your roots and make the Earth a better place to live for future generations by reusing many of your day-to-day items, ranging from plastic grocery bags to sandwich baggies and water bottles. You can start implementing a zero-waste philosophy during your workouts by eliminating the waste of plastic water bottles and paper water cups commonly found at workout facilities and endurance events. Instead, bring your own reusable water container with you during all of your workout activities and carry a reusable bottle with you throughout your day to ensure that your daily water drinking routine is green.
Recycle: One of the best ways to make your workout routine green this spring is to incorporate your daily calorie burn with giving back to the community once or twice each month. For instance, you can volunteer at a local recycling center to get a good workout lifting and organizing recyclable goods. You also can get up and get active outside the house by recycling your lawn and garden clippings.   Take your workout routine to greener levels this summer by incorporating these few simple tips into your daily life and fitness regimen. By getting outside and getting active you will not only make a difference in your health and fitness, but also help to make a difference in the world and community in which you live."

Felicity was rocked by the news that she would never conceive children normally when diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS at only 24.

After struggling with her weight since her early 20s, she was diagnosed with PCOS and told she would likely never get pregnant. Felicity joins me on the podcast to share with you her story of discouragement followed by hope and a happy ending.

Beyond the Dumbbells Show,"Lifestyle and fitness experts Brian & Jenny Sweeney share real talk about relationships, nutrition, business, and mindset k-bombs in a format that challenges the status quo. Counter-opinion dialogue that will inform and entertain. This is an unbelievably inspiring story about the strength of the human spirit. Heather gets candid with us about the event that changed the course of her life forever and how that experience led to a new purpose and a new lease on life.  It's the new year - you may have felt pressured to start a new year fitness program, kick some bad habits, or just get your sh*t together. There are two ""waves"" of fitness gypsies this time of year, the people that jump into a new ""thing"" without planning and structure and those that look for something else to do by the middle of January. The second wave people represent the bulk of people that really want to make change in the coming year but have initially chosen an incompatible path. 
 
We also get into how to manage expectations. Not just expectations with your health but the expectations you have on your loved ones and the expectations they have on you. If you're looking to master your relationships, your health, and your future get in deep with what you expect of yourself and others.  The nutrition side of the conversation and how to keep up with the difficult peeps on your life in food-filled wine-fest. :) This is the greatest birthday song ever sung 🤣😂!!! Happy Birthday to Mrs. Weeney.Birfday Cake ... Written and performed by Omar K. Mills IG @omarkmills  Part one of a two-part series on ... nothing much at all. 😂
Chatting about what we love about the holidays and how to not come out on the other side of New Years up 10 pounds.  At some point, the training wheels have to come off. No guru, graduate program, certification, mentor, or ""coach"" can get you to the top. Too many times we rely on the affirmation and guidance of other people and other things to prove to the world our value and worth. Copying someone successful doesn't translate to your success - being different does. Being original. Being confident. Being YOU."

We also discuss the P.H.I.T Act and what it might do to improve the health of the nation.

Big John Big Life,"It's a weight loss journey with me Big John! My struggles, my triumphs, my passions with a #gungholetsgo attitude that's powered by DDPYoga! I am also a professional speaker and I speak on Branding, Personal Branding and organizational Culture under my #the7rainbowprinciples program. The first of my Fat Conversation series, this first interview is with someone who has had struggles with weight-loss issues his entire life. He finally made the decision to go under the knife to change his life. I wanted to do this segment to give people a different dimension to weight-loss and to hear different perspectives behind it. It's not for everyone, but it's good to be in the know. As part of the 7 Rainbow Principles today I talk about the colour Blue and it's all about communication! Listen, share and be there for each other! Continuing with the 7 rainbow principles with the colour Green which is to 'lead'. Change the way you think to not only embrace change but to create it. This is a continuation of The 7 Rainbow Principles program and today I talk about 'Serve'. This is all about you playing an active role, no matter how big or small to help someone. Be it sharing your experiences or expertise. In today's episode I continue with #the7rainbowprinciples. I talk about how you can strategize for the new year and how to create measurable and achievable goals for yourself. It's more of a 'work mode' episode so roll your sleeves up! Part of my 'The 7 Rainbow Principles Program' in this episode I share the importance of discovering yourself, because the faster we discover, the faster we accept things and we move ahead to fix them and make better versions of ourselves."

Birth Ready and Beyond: from Mom Through Menopause,"The Birth Ready & Beyond podcast is ESPECIALLY for women 35+ that are simultaneously navigating pregnancy or postpartum changes, families, careers, and more.There is SO MUCH that goes UNSAID or is DISMISSED when it comes to our health journey... let's change that!We will get real, vulnerable, and provide SUPPORT, GUIDANCE, and INSPIRATION. You will learn from myself and experts on all things pelvic and core health, sexual health, mental health, hormone health, fitness and more. EMPOWERING you to live your BEST LIFE and FEEL amazing.Let’s LEARN, HEAL, and THRIVE together! Pelvic organ prolapse is a condition related to the downward migration of organs that sit inside the pelvis that can affect just under 50% of all women at some point in their lifetime.  Buffy discusses the unique and individual nature of this condition with Megan (a pelvic physical therapist) as well as a complementary and conservative tool called a pessary that can be used to provide women with symptom relief and help with getting back to an active full life. One of the reasons I began this podcast, blogging, and posting on social media about pelvic health is because of my daily interactions with people who have NEVER heard of PELVIC PHYSICAL THERAPY.  Ironically, pelvic health issues are INCREDIBLY COMMON among women of all ages and pelvic health PTs are the best first professionals to work with to resolve these issues.
In this episode, I go over what we do, what is our background and training, and what does working with a pelvic PT look like. If you’ve ever had a baby, then you KNOW that our bodies are not magically back to “normal” exactly 6 weeks after delivery.  Even though we may get cleared for intimacy at this time, there are MANY variables to consider and obstacles that may be unforeseen.
Juan Martin and Buffy, both pelvic health experts and moms discuss the physical, situational, and mental aspects of sex after baby.  It’s definitely a whole new ballgame and they give you insight to help you prepare and also to give yourself GRA When it comes to exercise and nutrition for us gals over 35, Lisa has some serious truth bombs about what REALLY matters in our pursuit of health.  With over 27 years of experience in the health and fitness industry, she gets past all of the fads and shares what REALLY matters.  
And she opens up about her recent explant surgery in her personal journey to greater health. In this episode, I share what I have learned about pelvic floor health and the mind-body connection.
Helping women reconnect their mind to their pelvic floor is key to their success… but it’s way more than just THINKING about our pelvic floor.
Listen and learn what you can do NOW to make a huge leap in your pelvic floor health! It’s about time we started talking about women’s health in a way that we can look at the entire journey, and not just one phase at a time.  Women deserve to hear honest discussions about what are our biggest health obstacles as women and what we can do throughout our adult life that not only helps us with feeling great now, but prepares us for a long and healthy life way beyond menopause.

In our very upbeat conversation we cover finding her confidence and spirit, her coaching pedigree, making difficult decisions, and adding value to our athletes. We also dig deep on how to evaluate progress, the importance of sticking to a plan, and consistency in our training. All ""strength is welcome"" on Episode 106 of Black Flag Radio with Steph Earl! For Episode 105 of Black Flag Radio we welcome two time Olympian, multiple records holder, student of weightlifting, and mentor of movement, Chad Vaughn. We discuss the current world events in the sport of Olympic Weightlifting, importance of health &amp; longevity, and the focus of his content.

Leah Casciano happens to be one of those athletes as an accomplished CrossFit Athlete, Olympic Weightlifter and Powerlifter. Coaching, training, and sharing her knowledge of sport as well as nutrition has become second nature. We uncover her path in the strength world, overcoming substance abuse, discovering the right environment, living an unconventional life, finding her niche, creating ""gangs"", and the finer the points of tattoos.  Enjoy!

Black Peach Optimization,"A podcast seeking optimization of the human condition. Physically, mentally spiritually and everything in between! The very first black peach optimization podcast! Laying the groundworks and letting you know who I am and what I'm about! Thank you for taking the time to join me today!"
Black Wolf Untitled,"A podcast focused on giving people hope of improvement and growth. Nobody is in this alone. And we all have experiences that will lift each other up. This is a channel where those can be shared. Happy Friday! The sun came out and it was a beautiful day. Y'all crushed ""Nancy"" (with Vanessa finishing the day with the fastest time at a blistering 12:13). 
After competing at Hammer &amp; Chisel this past weekend, the question has come up, how do you pick whether you should Rx or should Scale. And who is responsible for keeping the integrity in those divisions? Things are not how they once were. 
Let me know your thoughts.  Happy Friday everyone. I wanted to give my thoughts on 20.5 before y'all take it on tonight as well as some brief thoughts on the Open as a whole from the perspective of the affiliate. 
I also wanted to encourage y'all to come out to Hammer &amp; Chisel at Atomic CrossFit to cheer on Summer &amp; Steph, Angie &amp; Morgan, Manny &amp; Adrian, and Hunter &amp; myself. The comp starts around 9:30am and will be done or at least have the ""final WOD"" (only one division) by 2pm. Short and sweet. You know we appreciate that (Keep it simple stupid). 
Finally, I leave y'all with my most recent mental exercise/struggle. One mistake does not have to lead to EVERYTHING being wrong. Though it certainly may feel like that. I talk about one mistake that has forced this business into an unsustainable position and how, on the tough days, that can mean I feel like it is all a waste of time. But this mistake (made twice in the last 5 years) is able to be remedied and, therefore, not worth dwelling on. Learn and move forward. 
Y'all are awesome. I look forward to getting more content out to y'all in the coming weeks including a sit down with one of our newest one year anniversary athletes, Elle Belle herself!  Today, July 17th, is Crystal's Birthday! Be sure to wish her a happy birthday on her Instagram page, @CrystalMarieWellness
24:12: The article in question written by science journalist Apoorva Mandavilli 
My Son Got Lyme Disease. He’s Totally Fine. Find the article here. 
23:44: Crystals first thoughts after reading this article 
31:10: Crystal reads Ben’s favorite quote that she introduced to him earlier this week
44:12: The importance of sharing YOUR story, no matter how humble you believe your journey to be
53:52: Who has a responsibility/obligation to share?
“Great news! It’s Lyme Disease! That’s the best thing it could be!”
1:06:47: “So in conclusion” 
1:07:35: Surround yourself with the right people who support and push you Crystal Dunlap joined our team here at Black Wolf two months ago as the second coach in our Freestyle program, working alongside the amazing Kim Coble. 
Crystal's experiences developing coaches and programs around the world have positioned her to have a unique view on how to imprlment areas of focus into programs. We adopted this idea and now we roll out a theme for each month. 
This month we will be looking at mindfulness, introducing different practices and ideas each week in order to help all of us remain not in the past, not in the future, but here in the now. 
Resources: 
Of all of the resources available, my (Ben) favorite is episode 122 from the Tim Ferriss podcast. Here he lays out a few best practices that he has utilized to help him remain in the now. 
Another short post that was impactful to me comes from Ryan Holiday, author of Ego is the Enemy and The Obstacle is the Way on his blog  
1:57- Joel begins to lay out the schedule for the teams traveling to Austin for The Fittest Experience this weekend. Joel and Miranda are on separate teams but competing Saturday and Sunday. 
 
4:20- The value of singing up for a competition 
 
21:05- The Fittest Experience is becoming the Texas version of Wodapalooza 
 
23:20- Ben thinks this years CrossFit games might just be a huge s**t show
 
24:15- Cheating by CrossFit Games athlete in The Open? Here is a link from Morning Chalk Up catching you up on the controversy. https://morningchalkup.com/2019/04/24/elite-athletes-call-for-improvements-to-hqs-video-review-amid-devin-ford-controversy/
 
29:31- Quite a few CrossFit Games athletes are incredibly well educated and intelligent
 
33:10- We had 10 athletes compete at the Festivus Games hosted by CrossFit 1836 in Humble. And they all did awesome
 
34:05- Hey owners and coaches, Ben is sick of you teaching your athletes it’s ok to maintain poor standards of movement. We are done blaming the judges. This is on the affiliate and the local gym these athletes come out of. Why on earth is happening inside of your 4 walls? Take some pride in what you teach. 
 
38:45- The story of the Houston Area Affiliate Community criticizing an affiliate owner for pointing out rampant trash reps at a competition that was $100 per team. All he said was this is not right and the response from literally everyone was that he should mind his business………… 
 
41:30- Another example of how nobody can do a good deed without someone (many someones more often than not) having some s****y thing to say about it. Looking at you animal rescue “advocates.”

BLISTER Podcast,"The Blister Podcast is Blister's series of weekly conversations with the most fascinating and passionate people in the outdoor sports world. We’ll talk with top-level skiers, climbers, mountain bikers, snowboarders, product designers, and various Blister reviewers about their sport, their industry, and whatever else is on their minds— or ours. Wendy Fisher is one of the all-time greats. She is a two-time World Extreme Skiing Champion; was on the U.S. Ski Team; filmed with Warren Miller and MSP; and played a huge role in showing the world what women could do in big-mountain arenas. We spoke to Wendy about all of this and more (including a few fantastic Shane McConkey and Seth Morrison stories).
TOPICS &amp; TIMES:
Growing up racing (1:40)From Squaw to Burke Ski Academy (3:15)Thoughts on different learning styles (7:17)Highlights &amp; lessons from the US Ski Team (15:06) Meeting Kristen Ulmer (19:30)Big Mtn Comp at Crested Butte with Shane McConkey (22:00)Ski Filming (30:20)Making Seth Morrison’s short list (33:50)Thinking with your heart, not your head (35:00)The fear of failure (37:55)Western vs. Proust - Q&amp;A (45:50) In the world of ski and ski boot design, Thor Verdonk is well known and very well respected. So we talked to Thor about his background, his 25+ year career with the Rossignol Group and how he became the Global Brand Director for Lange. Then we discuss the history of ski design and ski boot design, including the pendulum swings we see in the ski industry; the biggest advancements in skis and ski boots; developing the Rossi S7; and we get Thor’s predictions about what the ski industry will look like 10 years from now. 
And to hear Thor talk about the brand-new Lange XT3 and the future of Lange, check out our GEAR:30 conversation.
TOPICS &amp; TIMES:
Growing up in Vermont (3:45)Coaching ski racing (7:20)Getting connected with Rossignol (9:10)Pendulum swings in product design (16:40)Biggest advancements in skis? (24:25)Biggest advancements in ski boots? (27:25)Developing the Rossignol S7 (35:27)Most overlooked ski boot developments (42:06)Thor’s industry predictions for the decade (50:05) Geoff McFetridge is an iconic designer and visual artist who’s worked with the Beastie Boys, Pharrell Williams, Spike Jonez and Rick Rubin, and companies ranging from Patagonia, Nike, the New York Times, Oreo, and many more. Geoff is also a passionate skateboarder and skier, and a big fan of … BLISTER (?!?!?).
So Jonathan Ellsworth and Geoff tell the story of how they first got connected; how Geoff went from being a sponsored skater to starting a skateboard company to doing design work for some of the biggest companies, bands, musicians, and directors in the world. They discuss Skate vs. Ski vs. Snowboard culture; being a “conflicted” telemarker; and a whole lot more.

(1:50:01) What will the ski &amp; snowboard industry look like 10 years from now? Will backcountry skiing and splitboarding keep growing? Will indoor ski areas become more common? Will there be fewer or more ski companies in existence 10 years from now? Paul Forward, Sam Shaheen, Luke Koppa and I offer our thoughts on all of these questions and more.

A recent conversation with Brendan Leonard (semi-rad.com) got us thinking that we should take a more creative approach to New Year’s Resolutions and goals, and see if they might become more than a guilt-inducing chore.
Specifically what prompted all of this is that Brendan had committed himself before the start of 2019 to run 52 marathons in 52 weeks — and he did it. So we are reposting here the conversation I had with Brendan on our Off The Couch podcast, and then very soon, we’ll be posting a series of short interviews with some Blister reviewers and other folks we like about their own take on new year’s resolutions, and some of their own creative goals.
Please enjoy, and let us know in the show notes to this episode what goals or resolutions you are setting for yourself for this brand new decade we’re quickly approaching.

 Become more Client-Centered, and less Coach-Centered
 Ask good questions to practice active, compassionate listening
 Focus on what’s awesome, not what’s awful
 Set the right kinds of goals
  Establish the right practices to reach those goals
  Always confidence test
  Speak in a way that makes people more likely to change

Today's episode we hear from APTM Derek Fox! We'll also hear from a couple of our awesome Brooklyn based CM's. Hear some PT Core 1 feedback and insight into PT Core 2.

Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/phil-t9/message This weeks email takes a look into the 5th part of “The Super 7 Coaching Principles” from John Berardi’s book Change Maker.

At first glance this email look very long but don’t let that be intimidating this concept is actually pretty straight forward and easy to implement. There’s 2 parts to turning “bad” goals into “good” ones. First there’s the 3 step process:


 Turn outcome Goals into Behavior goals
 Turn avoid goals into approach goals
  Turn performance goals into mastery goals.

The second part is to leverage what he calls the 5S formula to create the best daily practices.



Also, how coaches can position themselves as a source of strategy, guidance and support with regard to nutritional documentaries like Game Changers.

http://www.topfatlosstrainer.com/2009/12/12/cheat-day-for-rapid-fat-loss/ Gaining muscle is the fastest way to lose weight and change your body composition to more muscle and less fat, which will help you more than any other form of education. If you correspond with a lot of muscle mass, you should choose the lean zone. You will benefit from strength training and explosive core, but you will not add more mass, which is good because the weight ratio power is crucial in endurance sports.

Gaining muscle is also the best for fat loss fab. Simply workouts that target more than one joint. Bench presses, squats, pull-ups, dead lifts, lunges-just to name a few-these are a few of the best exercises to lose belly fat. Myth two “ab specific” exercise programs are the best for burning belly flab. Crunches are not as effective as most in fact I think it probably could be eliminated entirely and still see good results. They should make up a tiny share of your workout-they aren't nearly as urgent for losing stomach flab as the majority think.

I was thrilled to find a mechanism and a lot of scientific studies that support my feeling that cheat days can be used strategically to produce a rapid loss of fat.

Honestly, it was prime time lucky BIG coz little cheat days after the study of the tactics I discovered that a family nutrition expert strategy was released with a regime that has used this exact concept board to produce better results in the loss of fat.

Even though I was angry that he beat me the punch and came out with the first product I agree its acquisition and was very impressed. He had done his duty and the system of diet was very comprehensive.

That's why I'm proud partner and I can recommend this weight loss solution to all my readers TopFatLossTrainer because I know it works and I did research on the science behind it. You can learn more about this solution melting fat diet here: Top Fat Loss Diet Review.

It was a great relief to me because I freakin love eating, especially when it comes to foods rich in carbohydrates that each system tells you to avoid. Seriously, I always feel bad for my parents, because 
when I was young, I know that have cost a fortune in grocery bills.

I've always been too hard to eat clean for too long. It was only a matter of time before dropping the wagon damn fat loss and go on a binge for a week because I felt so lost a great-tasting comfort food.

You know that feeling? I'm sure it does.

Therefore using a weekly cheat day gives you a huge psychological advantage to go along with internal benefits which improve the metabolism.

Not just a trick a day to promote rapid fat loss through a series of hormonal effects, but allows you to enjoy your favorite foods and look forward to indulging in them once a week. I think this is a great majority of ordinary people who do not have the discipline, a world-class bodybuilder.

But still once a week cheat day to produce rapid fat loss really is not an easy piece of advice to lose weight to understand, much less begin to dispense with some concerns.

I know that is what many of you think, and I really just had a question about this policy regime from one of my VIP members TopFatLossTrainer. Here are your questions about cheat days and fat loss at http://www.topfatlosstrainer.com/2009/12/12/cheat-day-for-rapid-fat-loss/ http://www.topfatlosstrainer.com/celebrity-workouts/

Lose weight are more likely to report trying to lose weight than those not advised. However, the impact of advice may be dependent on having a regular physician. Studies have shown that having a regular physician is associated with increased medication adherence, increased preventive care and better control of chronic disease.

If you have never joined an online weight loss program before, you may be wondering a little bit more about how they work. Despite the possibility of a variance, you should find that most online weight loss programs are more than worth your money, especially if you regularly find yourself pressed for time.

BRB Podcast!  The most underground podcast on the Internet.,"The BRB Podcast Crew gets together every week to discuss a variety of ‘Things’ and no subject is off limits. Well, there are topics we really don’t care about, those are off limits, but everything else is game. BRBPodcast makes it a point to delve deep into the raw fleshy underbelly of this mortal coil, leaving our audience wanting more (or nothing at all). So, what does it mean to be the most underground podcast on the internet? Other than a super cool name, it means we have no ties to creepy big business or The Man, and we make no money, have no filters, and answer to no one (until we sell out). This gives us the unfiltered opportunity to share our combined wisdom (otherwise known as “The Wisdom of A 1000 Two Year Olds”) to the world in a series of ham-fisted conversation. Only the few will listen and less of those few will understand (so basically, like 1 to 5 people). Join us, every week, on our quest to dig deep into the issues, and burrow into the proverbial earth.

BreakingFit podcastas,"BreakingFit podcaste diskutuojame su įvairiais žmonėmis, sportininkais, gydytojais, treneriais ir kitais savo srities specialistais aktualiomis sveikatos, sporto, mitybos, psichologijos, biohakingo temomis bei tai, kaip optimizuoti savo kūną ir protą tam, kad iš gyvenimo galėtume pasiimti visa ką geriausio. BreakingFit.lt - tai progresyvus požiūris į žmogaus sveikatą, pasitelkiant naujausius, mokslu patvirtintus metodus bei biohakingą, kad išplėstume savo galimybių ribas ir taptume kuo produktyvesni, efektyvesni ir ilgaamžiškesni. BreakingFit - tai sąmoningų žmonių judėjimas. Tvirtai tikime, kad BreakingFit rastos žinios apie sportą, mitybą, mąstymą ir sveikatą yra tai, kas padės žengti tvirtus žingsnius ne tik ilgalaikės geros savijautos link, bet ir tapti laimingesniais. Labas! Čia ir vėl aš, Aurelija, ir BreakingFit naujas podkasto epizodas. O jame - dar nediskutuota tema - sunkioji atletika. Apie ją kalbame su sunkiosios atletikos atstovu, daugkartiniu Lietuvos čempionu, Europos turnyrų dalyviu, sunkiosios atletikos treneriu Mindaugu Januliu. 


Šiame sporte Mindaugas jau beveik 10 metų, todėl man buvo įdomu ne tik jo paklausinėti apie pačio weightliftigo plonybes, bet ir jo patirtį būnant atletu ir treneriu. Tuo labiau, kad pašnekovas treniruoja ne tik vaikus, bet ir suaugusiuosiu. Man pačiai sunkioji atletika - viena preciziškiausių sporto šakų po gimnastikos, ir ne ką lengviau perprantama tiek psichologiškai, tiek fiziologiškai. Tad daug kalbėjome apie treniravimą, varžybinį rengimą, atletų ir trenerių stipriąsias, silpnasias savybes bei įgimtus ir įgytus pranašumus. 


Na, o prieš tai tik noriu visiems priminti, kad vasario 1 d. laukiame jūsų seminare “Kaip sportuoti protingai”, kuris vyks sporto ir sveikatingumo studijoj “Sportis”, Ogmios mieste. Seminare kalbėsime apie tai:


- Kaip ir nuo ko pradėti? 


- Kokį sportą geriausia pasirinkti?


- Kokiu intensyvumu? 


- O kaip visa tai turėtų kisti laikui bėgant? 


- Kaip apskritai pasiekti to, kad sportas taptų gyvenimo būdu?


Jei tokie klausimai kyla ir tau ar tavo artimiesiems – šis renginys skirtas būtent jums! Pats renginys yra mokamas, bet kiek - priklauso nuo jūsų. Žodžiu - kiek kas gali, tiek įmeta į dėžutę prieš renginį. Patronams, žinoma, nemokamai.


Na, o dabar - paklausom podkasto! Labas rytas, su tavimi sveikinasi naujasis, pirmasis mūsų podkasto epizodas! O jame svečiuojasi dietologas, Santaros klinikų rezidentas Edvard Grišin. Be savo sukauptų žinių studijose ir klinikinės patirties Edvard dirba ir su sportininkais, įskaitant top lygio atletus, tad ir mūsų pokalbis gavosi gan platus ir labai įdomus: 


- Kalbėjome apie tai, kaip vietoj plano tapti chirurgu Edvard pasirinko dietologo specialybę.


- Šiuolaikinius valgymo įpročius ir su tuo susijusias problemas bei dažniausias daromas klaidas.


- Apie dietas apskritai ir jų pritaikymą praktikoje: nuo keto iki vegan.


- Apie jo pačio santykį su maistu ir išbandytas dietas.


- Apie sporto mitybos įpatumus ir plonybes.


- Keisčiausius darbinius kuriozus.


- Bendrąsias mitybos taisykles bei kuo jos turėtų skirtis nuo ištvermės ir jėgos sportu užsiimančiųjų.


- Apie maisto papildų vartojimą ir ekologiją.


- Ir, žinoma, aptarėme veganų dietą bei filme “The Game Changers” pateikiamą medžiagą.


- Pabaigai atsakėme ir į mūsų sekėjų siųstus klausimus.


Tiesa, už kadro liko dar daug įdomių dalykų, todėl tikrai dar nekartą Edvard svečiuosis mūsų podkaste. Na, o dabar kviečiu paklausyti tai ką jums paruošėme šiandien! Šiandien, šiame prieš šventiniame epizode prie puodelio arbatos kartu su Monika kalbiname vos 13 metų turinčią, bet itin perspektyvią ledo ritulio žaidėją Lietuvoje Emiliją Tučiūtę. Ši jauna mergina stebina ne tik savo branda, disciplina, bet ir yra tikras įkvėpimas visiems jauniems ir vyresniems žmonėms, kaip siekti užsibrėžtų tikslų. Tam, kad išugdytų kuo geresnius įgūdžius, Emilija treniruojasi su vaikinų ir moterų komandomis, o negalėdama sudalyvauti treniruotėse savo kūną lavina sportuodama individualiai. Puikūs rezultatai moksluose ir sporte, išankstinės derybos dėl moterų rinktinės verčia manyti, jog kalbame su nauja ne tik Lietuvos, bet galbūt ir pasaulio žvaigžde. Taigi, kviečiu paklausyti šio mūsų pokalbio. Kalbiname visiems žinomą, bet mažai kam artimiau pažįstamą CrossFit atletą Paulių Brilingą. Paulių galime drąsiai vadinti kiečiausiu Lietuvoje gyvenančiu CrossFit atletu. Kas sekate CrossFit Games, suprantate, kodėl. O kalbėjome mes įvairiom temom: apie vaikystę, paauglystę, iškeistus mokslus Anglijoje į universitetą Lietuvoje, pasirinktą karjeros sritį, krepšinio karjerą ir, žinoma, CrossFit’ą. Kaip treniruojasi geriausias atletas, kaip maitinasi, koks jo darbo-poilsio režimas ir netgi trenerio karjerą. Visa tai išgirsite šiame epizode! Labas! Su tavimi sveikinasi Aurelija ir ... nauja rubrika “BreakingFit short’ai”. Iki šiol podcaste kalbinau svečius labai plačiom temom - nuo jų gyvenimo istorijų iki įvairių kitų temų. Bet, galiausiai nusprendžiau paleisti epizodų seriją, kuriuose aptarsime vieną konkrečią temą, neišsiplečiant ir taip taupant visų laiką. Taigi, jau praėjusiose laidose minėjau, kad prie BreakingFit komandos prisijungė mūsų mylima kineziterapeutė Santa Povilonytė Žilinskienė, su kuria gruodžio 14 d. turės progos susipažinti mūsų patronai, atvykę į seminarą “Kaip sportuoti protingai”. Tačiau, savo žiniomis Santa dalinsis ne tik mūsų seminaruose, bet ir straipsniuose, audio ir video (taip taip - bus ir video! Yey!). Tad pirmasis short’ų epizodas ir yra su Santa, kuriame kalbame apie pėdas ir kaip pati Santa sako - jos yra mums tokios svarbios, kaip namui pamatas. Todėl kalbėjome apie tai: kokios dažniausios pėdų problemos vargina žmones; kodėl jos atsirada; kokią įtaką turi minėtos problemos likusiam mūsų kūnui, ypač sportuojantiems; kiek padeda ortopediniai vidpadžiai; apie prevencines priemones ir problemų tvarkymą iš esmės. Visa tai ir dar daug daugiau išgirsite netrukus. Na, o prieš tai norėčiau skirti dėmesio mūsų mylimiems patronams. Beproto diiidelis diiidelis AČIŪ skrieja: Gustei, Erinei, Ruslanui ir Daniel. AČIŪ, kad mus palaikote, remiate mūsų darbus ir tikite mūsų idėjomis! Nuo šiol nauji podcasto epizodai pasieks jus penktadieniais, o naujoji penktadienio laida su daugeliui pažįstamu treneriu Liutauru Kasparavičiumi! Puikiai ištreniruotas kūnas, nuolat besišypsantis veidas, draugiškas balso tembras, bet ar tikrai mes jį taip gerai pažįstame? Mums vis tik buvo labai smalsu sužinoti ne tik apie tai, kaip sportas atsirado jo gyvenime ir kokius išbandymus teko jam atlaikyti, kol ėmėsi treniruoti kitus, bet ir Liutauro vaikystę, paauglystę, pasirinkimus ir kitą gyvenimišką patirtį. Ir tikrai ne vieno jo atsakymo buvome nustebinti! Štai keletas temų, kurias aptarėme: 1) Apie gimtąjį miestą, pasirinktas studijas ir galiausiai - savanoriavimą kariuomenėje. 2) Kada ir kodėl Liutauras iškeitė Kauną į Vilnių. 3) Kaip ir kada sportas atsirado jo gyvenime? 4) Kokias sporto šakas yra pats išbandęs ir kokias didžiausias pamokas kiekviena jų išmokė. 5) Apie sunkų paauglystės laikotarpį. 6) Apie tai, kas yra laimė ir kas vis tik jį pykdo ar liūdina. 7) Dėmesys vs privatumas. 8) Kada ir kodėl Liutauras stipriai apmažino socialinių tinklų naudojimą. 9) Kas trenerio darbe yra lengviausia, o kas sunkiausia. 10) Kokias treniruotes mieliau renkasi vesti. 11) Kalbėjome apie savęs išbandymą įvairiose varžybose, išmoktas pamokas ir baigtą “karjerą”. 12) Apie tai, kiek darbo reikia įdėti, kad atrodytų taip kaip atrodo. 13) Ką Liutauras dabar veikia ir kur jį galima rasti kaip trenerį. 14) Bei apie meilę vaikams ir asmeninius ateities planus. Visa tai ir dar daug daugiau išgirsite šiame epizode. Na, o prieš tai dar norėčiau visiems priminti, jog BreakingFit - tai ne tik podcastas! Mūsų tinklalapyje rasite jau virš 30 mokslu grįstų straipsnių įvairiomis sporto, sveikatos temomis, o gruodžio 14 dieną visų patronų laukia BreakingFit seminaras “KAIP SPORTUOTI PROTINGAI”. Seminaras skirtas žmonėms, norintiems pakeisti savo gyvenimo būdą ir pradėti gyventi aktyviau. Jeigu kyla šie klausimai: Kaip ir nuo ko pradėti? Kokį sportą geriausia pasirinkti? Kokiu intensyvumu? O kaip visa tai turėtų kisti laikui bėgant? Kaip apskritai pasiekti to, kad sportas taptų gyvenimo būdu? Šis renginys skirtas būtent tau. Seminaro metu kiekvienas dalyvis ne tik įgaus neįkainojamų žinių, bet ir: turės galimybę įsivertinti savo dabartinių fizinių galimybių ribas; galės susidėlioti individualų savo kelio pradžios planą. Detalesnė informacija renginio aprašyme! Tiesa, tam, kad ne tik tų straipsnių sparčiau daugėtų ir podcastas toliau gyvuotų, bet ir daugėtų panašių renginių, atsirastų video - kviečiu tapti BreakingFit patronais. Jau dabar projektas reikalauja nemažai išlaidų, tad pirmas surinktas lėšas būtent ten ir panaudosime, tačiau tam, kad aprėptume kuo daugiau visus dominančių temų kuo įvairesniu formatu, turime ne tik skirti visą savo laiką, bet ir plėsti komandą. Na, o BreakingFit komanda sparčiai auga ir stiprėja: prie mūsų ne tik savanoriškai prisijungė mylima kineziterapeutė Santa Povilonyte, bet ir trečio kineziterapijos kurso studentė Vytautė Melkūnaitė! Šiuo metu kaip tik paleidome Vytautės, Santos ir dėstytojo, kineziterapeuto Tomo Juraičio bendrom pajėgom ruoštą stiprų straipsnį kineziterapijos teipavimo tema. Taigi, nuveiksime tikrai daugiau darbų visų labui, tad kviečiu užsukti į Patreon.com/breakingfit ir 1 puodelį kavos per mėnesį iškeisti į žinias visam gyvenimui. O diiidelis diiidelis AČIŪ jau skrieja mūsų pirmiesiems patronams: Loretai, Tomui, Astai, Julitai, Renatai ir Erikai. AČIŪ, kad mus palaikote, remiate mūsų darbus ir tikite mūsų idėjomis! Na, ir pagaliau kviečiu klausyti naujojo epizodo.

 Follow us on Instagram @brute.strength. This week on the Brute Strength Podcast I’m interviewing a Powerlifting legend, Jim Wendler. At his best Jim had a 1000lb squat, 675lb bench and 700lb deadlift, weighing in at 275lb. Jim is also the creator of the 5/3/1 method, one of the most successful strength programs to date. In this episode we get into his early days at University of Arizona Football, lifting, training, competing,  and of course coaching. Jim is a great story teller so it was definitely a pleasure to hear him get into some topics like why he created the 5/3/1 method and the importance of keeping things simple in life and in training in order to become a true master. Enjoy the show.

Support Building A Better Body"
Building Better Bodies,"Building a better body isn't just physical, we look at the holistic approach, of body and mind with industry leading experts giving you an insight into how they became industry leading, allowing you to use these tips and tricks to help you in your daily lives. The One with Adam Cooper. This week we talk all things Judo, Training and Mindset. We Talk All Things CrossFit. George Chuter Talks Rugby World Cup. Lewis Knight Chats Personal Training."
Building Healthy Bodies Audio Experience,"Building Healthy Bodies zorgt dat jij meer te weten komt over, voeding, training, mindset en lifestyle! Calorie tekort, de enige manier om af te vallen

Je komt aan als je meer calorieën binnen krijgt dan dat je verbruikt/nodig hebt. We herhalen, als je meer calorieën eet, dan dat je verbruikt/nodig hebt, kom je aan. 

Anders om werkt dat net zo: Je valt af, als je minder calorieën eet dan dat je verbruikt. 

Als je wilt afvallen, is dat dé enige manier om het voor elkaar te krijgen dus: Onder je calorie behoefte zitten.

Niet voor 1 dag, maar voor langere periode. (geldt voor beide!) 

In de podcast geven we een voorbeeld: 773 cal voor de gezonde opties en 760 cal voor de ongezonde opties. 

Kom je meer aan van de ongezondere opties, dan van de gezonde opties?  NEE❌
Kom je aan van de ongezondere opties en val je af van de gezonde opties? NEE ❌

Als het gaat om afvallen, moet je zorgen dat je dagelijks minder calorieën binnen krijgt dan je nodig hebt, over een langere periode ✔

Natuurlijk maakt het uit of zo onbewerkt mogelijk eet omdat dat GEZONDER is voor je lichaam. 
- Betere sport prestaties 
- Meer energie 
- Mooiere huid 
- Betere stoelgang 
- Minder kwaaltjes en andere mentale/lichamelijke klachten 

Note: Als je dan de macro’s goed timed, zorg je er voor dat je het geheel OPTIMALISEERT. Waardoor we je herstel nog meer optimaliseren bijvoorbeeld en waardoor je je energiek voelt tijdens je training. Maar het belangrijkste is dat je de hoeveelheden eet die in je schema staan als je wilt afvallen/aankomen.


Het antwoord: ‘Gezond eten’ of het antwoord : ‘combinatie van sporten en gezond eten’ is fout als het gaat om afvallen. Maar waarom?  

Omdat je 4 keer per week kan gaan sporten en gezonder kan gaan eten en kan aankomen. Sporten en gezond eten betekent niet dat je onder je calorie behoefte zit én dus afvalt. Als je nog steeds meer eet dan de hoeveelheid die je nodig hebt, val je niet af.❌ BHBLIFESTYLEMOVEMENT  update dag 20 
In deze podcast geven we een we update over de movement en hoe het tot nu toe gaat. 
Virgil en Gia vertellen beide hoe ze het tot nu toe ervaren. Gia vindt het vooral fijn dat ze niet hoeft ‘na te denken’ over wat te doen, aangezien er vaste regels/richtlijnen zijn. 
In de podcast wordt er besproken wat te doen als je één onderdeel niet hebt gedaan/af hebt gemaakt. Verder wordt er gesproken over het onderwerp: ‘Iets niet compleet afmaken’ en wat dit doet in en met je leven. Soms zijn dit kleine gebeurtenissen die onbelangrijk lijken, maar hebben ze op lange termijn een grote invloed op de belangrijke gebeurtenissen in het leven. Simpel, maar absoluut niet makkelijk. Als je iets wilt bereiken, moet je actie ondernemen, anders gebeurt het niet.

Dat geldt op ieder vlak. Als je wil afvallen, moet je actie ondernemen. Als je wilt sporten en fitter wilt worden, moet je actie ondernemen.Als je iets wilt, moet je er wat voor doen. Dag in dag uit, voor langere tijd.

Dat klinkt heel simpel, maar het is niet makkelijk. 
Makkelijk is; er over praten, er over lezen, er over nadenken en gemotiveerd/geïnformeerd worden door anderen. Maar dat is niet genoeg. Je zal: ZELF ACTIE MOETEN ONDERNEMEN.
Actie waar je niet direct iets van terug ziet. De eerste week van het sporten voel je je niet direct beter, de trainingen voelen zwaar en je merkt dat je niet fit bent. De eerste week dat je gezonder (en minder) eet val je niet direct af, misschien kom je zelfs wel iets aan. .

Als je op je werk taart aangeboden krijgt, is het makkelijk om ook lekker wat te nemen. “Nee” zeggen op dat moment is moeilijk. Om naar de gym te gaan na een lange dag werken, is moeilijk. Lekker op de bank gaan liggen en eten bestellen, is een stuk makkelijker. .

Maar als je een doel hebt die je graag wil bereiken is het belangrijk dat je een plan hebt voor jezelf en dat je je daar iedere dag aan houdt.

Simpel, maar niet makkelijk. Maar DAT is wel hoe je resultaat behaald. TAKE ACTION! BE PATIENT. DON’T QUIT.🙌 Wij van building healthy bodies willen jou zo goed mogelijk en zo duidelijk mogelijk informeren, op het gebied van voeding, training, herstel en mindset.

Podcast #003 - 

je houd je 12 weken lang aan de volgende regels:  
.
Dagelijks:  
- opstaan zonder te snoozen
- 2 minuten koud douchen
- 30 minuten buiten wandelen
- 10 blz. Lezen: lees iedere dag 10 blz uit een boek over persoonlijke ontwikkeling of een onderwerp in het verlengde daarvan. Geen waargebeurde verhalen, romances etc. 
- houd je aan een dieet. “no cheatmeals, no alcohol!” Welke ‘dieet’ je volgt, maar je zelf bepalen. Volg je onze schema’s, dan houd je je 100% aan je macro’s en aan de fases die je doorloopt. Heb je nog geen voedingsschema’s van ons? Deze hele maand krijg je 20% korting op de voedingsschema’s én coaching.
- benoem iedere dag 3 dingen waar je dankbaar voor bent: vaak benoemen we wat we graag zouden willen, of wat we nóg niet hebben. Laten we de focus eens verleggen naar wat we wél al hebben door dagelijks een moment te creëren waarin je terug denkt aan de dag en de dingen die je gedaan hebt.
.
Wekelijks 
- doe minimaal 3x per week een training van minimaal 30 minuten. Dit kan zijn een judo training, fitness training, voetbal training etc. 
- maak iedere week minimaal 1 progressie foto: soms heb je je eigen progressie niet door. Gebruik foto’s! 
.
Start: op 1 oktober tot 24 december, kerstavond. 
.
Dit is niet zomaar iets wat ‘leuk is om mee te doen’. Het wordt moeilijk! Als je er aan begint, is het ook de bedoeling om het af te maken. Hierdoor ontwikkel je een enorme hoeveelheid aan discipline, doorzettingsvermogen en zelfvertrouwen. 
.
Heb je al voedingsschema’s/coaching van ons? Dan is deze movement echt ‘next level’!
.
We droppen twee keer per maand een podcast met onderwerpen en vragen over bhblifestylemovement. 
.
Screenshot de bhblifestylemovement kalender! Voor de screenshot ga naar je naar @buildinghealthybodiesonline 🡪 ‘hoogtepunt 🡪 bhblifestylemovement.’  
.
X: de gehele maand september krijgt iedereen 20% korting op voedingsschema’s en coaching over 3 of 6 maanden! 
.
Deel dit bericht met iedereen die deze uitdaging aan wil gaan en zijn of haar leven naar een next level wil tillen!

Tijdens de voedingscoaching kwam naar voren dat een van onze BHB members die ontzettend goed haar voedingsschema volgde, het moeilijk vond om een eierkoek te nemen (binnen haar macro’s). Daarvoor in de plaats nam ze liever een flesje verse jus d’orange.

“Een eierkoek is ongezond en van ongezond eten word je dik.” Ze nam liever een flesje jus d’orange. “Dat is gezonder, dus daar val je wel van af. Toch? “

Wij leggen in deze podcast uit hoe het komt dat je afvalt of aankomt en of je wel of niet die eierkoek kan nemen als je wilt blijven afvallen."

Bulldog Strength &amp; Conditioning Podcast,"This Podcast explores all the hot topics in the realm of high school strength and conditioning with guests from the professional levels all the way down to high school. Our goal is to continue to educate, motivate, and continue to better the athletes we work with. In this episode, we are joined by our Registered Dietician James Whelan, Nate Harvey with EliteFTS, Christopher Chapman with Push, Joe Aratari with Penfield S&amp;C, and Jason Asvart with the Buffalo Bills. 

We answer questions submitted by summit attendees prior to the conference as well as some live questions from attendees. Take a listen with one of the best up and coming strength and conditioning coaches in the Upstate New York area and what got him into the field of strength and conditioning, how he connected with Next Level Strength and Conditioning and his role as the strength coach at Penfield High School. Throughout this episode, Joe and I highlight some of what sets Next Level Strength and Conditioning and Penfield apart from the other great programs in the area. We also hit on topics such as buy in with both sport coaches and athletes, pre season athlete screening, nutrition, recovery, training software (Train Heroic/ Teambuildr/ Push bands for velocity based training), as well as advice for the high school strength coach with programing in season vs off season programming. 

Leave feedback and enjoy the very much unedited version - keeping it real and having a blast!! Angelo T.  Buono, B.S, CSCS, is the Assistant Sports Performance Coach at the University of Buffalo where he works with Cross Country, Softball, Swimming and Diving, Women’s Tennis, and Track and Field. He has coached the 2017,2018 Women’s Tennis MAC Champions, 2014 Women’s Soccer MAC Champions, multiple individual MAC Track and Field, Swimming and Diving champions.

 In this episode, Angelo and I explore the misconceptions of strength and conditioning pertaining to swimmers and how important it is to utilize the weight room to develop strength, power, and build up muscular imbalances. 

Some topics include:

 - How can the weight room positively impact swimmers in regards to strength, power output, and injury reduction

- Is there any correlation between energy systems used in S&amp;C and swimming?

- What physiological adaptations of strength training can help swimmers?

- Swimmers at the high school level typically come in very strong aerobically but lack strength and power - why is strength and power essential to be a good swimmer?

- In regards to rest and taper before a meet: Do you completely drop all lifting at any point? If so, how far out from competition day do you stop? If you don’t completely remove lifting how much and at what speed do you reduce volume and/or intensity?

- Angelo's opinion of the top 5 exercises that all swimmers should be doing regardless of distance/stroke.

- Recovery Advice In this episode we talk to University of Georgia Director of Sports Nutrition, Jana Heitmeyer and explore the topic of nutrition and recovery for the high school athlete."
Bullets 2 Beans,"A military and veteran centric variety podcast focused on current military and veteran topics, blended with discussions on mountain oriented recreational and adventure based therapy programs.  This is the official podcast of Remedy Alpine. Taking a look at factors that could be contributing to the Veteran Suicide epidemic. What you can expect from the podcast series."
Bullshido,"With over 300,000 registered members and two decades of history, Bullshido has earned its reputation as the bad boys and girls of the Skeptics movement. Our primary mission is to help spread critical thinking skills as a means of what we call ""Self Defense Against BS""—something of extreme importance in an age of fake news, junk memes, anti-vaccination myths, conspiracy theories, and other forms of nonsense and stupidity the public seems to be susceptible to these days. Join the Bullshido crew for rowdy discussion on the topics of the day, news, and interesting guests with their own take on the Art of Fighting BS. Are “all cops bastards”, or is there something else going on that may explain why we’re seeing more stories about police shootings in the media lately? For this episode of Judo? In my Science Fiction? By an author who isn't trying to make a political statement? HELL YES. Bullshido sits down for a conversation to better understand ""Antifa"", because we're not snowflakes who hide in a bias bubble. A lot of you have been asking us to do martial arts-related stuff, so we changed things up a bit this time for you. Here's an episode of ""The Art of Fighting BS Podcast"" featuring a conversation between Michael ""Omega"" MacDonald and Sam ""Battlefields"" Fields—both of which you'll recognize from the Bullshido forums. With what seems to be an endless cycle of mass-shootings in the news, the Bullshido team takes on the tricky subject of Gun Control vs. Gun Rights with former Marine weapons instructor and current law student Derek Debus. Jason Goldsmith, MD, PhD, joins us to talk about the huge obesity problem in the US, and the actual scientific reasons behind it."
BunkerCast,"Sejam bem-vindos ao Bunker Cast!Todos sabemos quantas histórias inspiradoras nascem dentro de um box de CrossFit, sendo assim, porquê aquelas histórias devem ajudar e inspirar somente quem frequenta aquele box? O nosso objetivo é justamente acabar com isso. Vamos trazer pra vocês várias dessas histórias, para que juntos possamos nos inspirar e aprender com essas pessoas sensacionais! Sejam muito bem-vindas e muito bem-vindos ao BunkerCast!

Aqui quem fala é seu host, Axel Gouveia e hoje eu converso com o Tiago Moura, um dos coaches mais antigos da Bunker Recife.
O Tiago conheceu o CrossFit lá por meados de 2008-2009, pesquisando sobre treinamento funcional no YouTube, e desde então buscou
se desenvolver e aprender mais sobre a modalidade. Em 2012 voltou sua área de atuação completamente para o CrossFit e não olhou mais
pra trás. 

Obrigado por estarem ouvindo e bora pro e E ai! Sejam muito bem-vindas e muito bem-vindos ao BunkerCast!

Aqui é o Axel Gouveia hoje eu converso com o Francisco Cabrera. E que história incrível de superação esse cara tem. Com dificuldades para manter um peso saudável desde pequeno, ele chegou a pesar 150 kilos com 16 para 17 anos, nesse momento uma chave virou na sua cabeça e conseguiu perder 60 kilos. Pouco tempo depois, com alguns problemas e algumas lesões acabou engordando de novo, chegando aos 120 kilos, e ai conheceu o CrossFit... E ai! Sejam muito bem-vindas e muito bem-vindos ao BunkerCast!
.
Hoje nós conversamos com a Mariana Saldanha e a Fabíola Lima, da Pharmapele. A Pharmapele é uma das maiores farmácias de manipulação do país e vem investindo e apostando alto no CrossFit como um de seus nichos, a partir daí, a Mariana contou como a modalidade entrou para sua vida pessoal e como mudou seu relacionamento com a atividade física. Depois a Fabíola explicou pra gente o papel de alguns suplementos e seus benefícios. E ai! Sejam muito bem-vindas e muito bem-vindos ao BunkerCast!
 .
 Aqui é o Axel Gouveia hoje a Babe Azevedo não vai se juntar a nós, gravamos na segunda passada, ressaca ou morte pós 20.1? Tirem suas próprias conclusões haha. Mas vamos lá, o episódio de hoje é com o Thiago Moch. O Thiago é sócio da agência de publicidade que fez um trabalho sensacional no início da Bunker Equilíbrio. Nossa conversa começou com como ele foi parar nesse meio, o desenvolvimento da agência com o passar dos anos e mudança de mercado e conversamos bastante sobre levar seu produto ou serviço para o meio digital. O Thiago é quase um nômade digital, passa algumas temporadas fora do país, trabalhando à distância e a conversa se desenvolveu explorando esse lado, como ele faz, países mais legais que já visitou e por ai foi!

Aqui é o Axel Gouveia e no episódio de hoje eu e a Babe Azevedo conversamos com VIvian Alves, mais conhecida como Vivi. Pra quem a conhece somente daquela horinha na aula do box em que ela toca o terror, se prepare pra se surpreender. Tivemos um papo muito legal sobre sua carreira, fases da vida, círculo social, alimentação e claro, sobre CrossFit.  Bem-vindos ao BunkerCast!

Aqui é o Axel Gouveia e no episódio de hoje eu e a Babe Azevedo conversamos com o Nando. Os alunos antigos da Sampa já o conhecem muito bem, ele dá aula no box desde sua abertura e até hoje é o coach de todas as aulas da manhã. Nossa conversa começou com o background esportivo do Nando e sua decisão de seguir a carreira de educador físico, depois passamos para como conheceu o CrossFit e foi se voltando completamente para a modalidade, tanto como professor como atleta."

Calgary Fitness Podcast,"Helping you find the best information on health and fitness in the Calgary and surrounding area. Mike is the owner of Revive Lifestyle Fitness, which is in the Beltline, along 14th St. S.W. What we learned: that training in your 20s is far different than training in your 30s, 40s and 50s. That’s why his studio focuses on low-impact HIIT training to protect your joints and keep you healthy for the long term. Rob is a pilot of more than 20 years, but noticed there are so many stressors on the job that he decided to do something about it. He helps other people in an airport environment, but the information he shares is very applicable to the everyday person. Vincci Tsui is a Calgary Registered Dietitian. In Episode 4, we spoke about how to eat intuitively, why counting calories can lead to obsessive behaviour and why you need to listen and trust your body, instead of trying to force what’s not working. Loving yourself is the big theme in this podcast. Rachel Joy Olsen, who has more than 20 years in the health and fitness space in Calgary speaks about what results are, how to actually sustain them and why it’s more than just a number on a scale. Matt Kellett is a former CFL player, who found his passion in fitness. After several years of training at World Health Club, he made the switch to Orangetheory Fitness in 2014. Now, he helps train a group of fitness professionals at both the Royal Oak and Kensington locations, plus he coaches hundreds of clients every week in group training style. The first episode is just an intro into what we’re doing. Calgary is a beautiful city with a lot of stories to tell. If you want to be featured on the podcast, email me at justin@justinslimm.com"

Champions of Data - Polar Podcast,"Champions of Data takes you on a journey into the world of sports and performance. You’ll be hearing hands-on tips and inspiring stories from top athletes and coaches and digging deep into the background of successful training with leading scientists. Subscribe now and discover how to train smarter and become the athlete you want to be. No matter if you’re a pro athlete or just getting started with training for your first running event, dreams and goals are important building blocks for motivation. For pro runner Molly Huddle, dreams fuel long-term motivation whereas goals help her stay committed to putting in the work every day. A runner has to constantly push the limits in order to improve, but in the end, the best reward – race day – makes it all worth it. Listen and find out how Molly prepares for races and gets through the rough patches. This episode brings us back to one of the key themes in training: recovery. This time we’re taking a more scientific approach – Polar’s very own recovery specialist, senior researcher Ph.D. Daniela Schäfer Olstad will explain to us what recovery means from the science perspective and takes us through some basic concepts. Training load, supercompensation, autonomic nervous system… Listen and find out how they’re connected. Siri Lindley has been coaching triathletes ever since she wrapped up her own career as a professional athlete, and nowadays she’s also an esteemed speaker and author. For Siri, a successful coaching relationship isn’t just about training plans (which still play an important part, of course) – it’s about really getting to know her athletes and finding their ‘why’. Listen to what Siri has to say about failing and success, finding the greatest strengths within and building a good coach-athlete relationship. Pro athlete Emma Pallant made the transfer from running to triathlon in 2016. Being quite new to the sport, she’s constantly testing new things in her training and looking for the best ways to maximize her performance. A big part of this is finding the optimal amount of training and the best ways to recover from intense sessions. In this episode, Emma shares her best tips for both physical and mental recovery and tells us how and why she tracks her recovery. Sleep is nature’s own doping method, says Dr. Henri Tuomilehto, the sleep specialist whose mission is to help pro athletes and regular people alike to understand the value of a good night’s sleep. In this episode, we find out how sleep affects an athlete’s performance and what actually happens in the human body during sleep. Dr. Tuomilehto also shares some of his best tips on how to sleep better. Can you really improve your sleep if you’re light sleeper by nature? Listen to find out. CrossFit is a relatively new sport, but it has been growing quickly from the very beginning. The fast growth has brought some drastic changes, and during her 10-year competitive career, professional CrossFit athlete Annie Thorisdottir has seen how the sport has evolved into one of the most intense competitive sports in the world. In this episode, Annie and her coach/partner Frederik talk to us about the CrossFit world, using technology to improve, and how a great community can help you become a better athlete. Join us and take a peek into the world of competitive CrossFit."

We have become 'departmentalised' in the way we describe / acknowledge ourselves in medical terms (boxes) when we are much more than this as 'whole beings'. We are important in our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health and self care can be simplistic as can the tools and techniques we can apply.

Our Guest will be Daniel Whittaker

Born and raised in London, England, I’ve always been able to see Auras and Universal Energy. The first time this ability came to light, was when I was 3 years old.

At that age, my dad told me that I looked at him and said ""Dad, why are you yellow"", to which he replied, ""Im not yellow, im black!"", him being from the Caribbean.

I then said to him ""no.. You are yellow here, here and here"", motioning to the areas around his head. It was at that point that my father concluded that perhaps I was seeing his aura.

Later in life, especially on hot days, when looking up into the sky I became aware of these tiny specks of dancing light. Little globules of light moving independently of each other. These little specks of light were always more present during the summer, and less so during the colder months.

I later learned that what i was observing was ""orgone energy"" or Universal Energy. And it was everywhere!

Later in life the visions increased, and my observations became more detailed. I was able to see when words didn’t match the emotion being expressed by certain individuals. My sensitivity to this phenomenon was developing. In my mid 20's I took up life coaching and became well versed in mental techniques such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, and Neuro Linguistic Programming.

I started to become aware of the fact that not only can I see the energy field, I can also feel it. I can feel the subtleties that each change in this energy field exhibits.

I became aware that by playing with this field and moving my hand around began to restore the field. My hands would warm up and the energy field would correct itself.

Those experiences were the foundations of Synergistic Energy Therapy and are responsible for what I have created here.

It is constantly evolving as I delve deeper into myself and reveal more and more of what Im actually capable of.

So this is where I give back. I've learned that this is how I help to improve our existence, that this is my service to humanity.

Come and find out more about this Energy and how it can play a part in your life.

About the Hormone Fairy Cat Robinson Armor

Just before my 40th birthday, I started to feel like you. I was showing early signs of peri menopause, mood swings, night sweats and weight gain, rocky relationships and irregular period.

We talk about the following in this video

What is Hormone Replacement Therapy

What are the benefits of HRT
What are the downsides of HRT
What natural solutions would you suggest to your clients

In her application to be a Featured Athlete during her training for the TCS New York City Marathon on November 3, Andrea posed many of her marathon goals as questions: “Can I still get faster? How much of that is mental and how much is physical? How do I push myself and still stay on the right side of injury? And how do I balance the time demands of training with parenting?” These are questions that so many runners ask. We ask them ourselves, and so we knew we wanted to do whatever we could to help Andrea, even the slightest bit, to find her answers at this moment in her journey. Andrea’s curiosity, commitment, and willingness to get as much out of her training cycle as possible was, and continues to be, inspiring to us. This is a wonderful story about the fruits of setting goals and taking advantage of a window of opportunity. This is a wonderful account of what ultimately turned out to be an ideal training cycle…and race. Andrea had the race we all hope for but don’t always get. Thank you Andrea for your hard work, accountability, and steadfast commitment to yourself and your goals. Brian is an experienced and skilled runner. He is also a coach and an important mentor to the Chill Track Friday coaches. When Brian applied to be a Featured Athlete we were delighted, yet surprised. We wondered what more we could offer him than what he already has. That’s one of Brian’s defining characteristics, though: he maintains a beginner’s mindset and is willing to learn from whomever he can. This quality defines the spirit of Chill Track Friday and the goals of our Featured Athlete series so we were honored to accept him. In his application, Brian highlighted that his desire to be a Featured Athlete was to have accountability for his own goals. Because he was coaching many runners and pacing many races, his training was suffering. Brian’s journey is one of expansion, heart, and dedication to a higher purpose. This is a beautiful story of how running can be a tool of service and love for others. It was truly a privilege to have the opportunity to help someone who has helped us so much. Thank you, Brian. In her application to be a Featured Athlete while training for the BMW Berlin Marathon, Melissa described herself as someone who had been running on-and-off for years. Initially she ran once a week to lose weight; she did not yet understand what “training” was. After running a few races with friends however, Melissa realized that she loved the race atmosphere and wanted more. She was still showing up to these races without preparing for them though, and with a new commitment to running more she decided to start training with a group. Melissa joined NYRR Group Training in September 2017. Every step of Melissa’s journey has demonstrated commitment to self, as well as a sense of curiosity. These attributes are the fibers that run through endurance athletes. They are what bring us back to the starting line time and time again. They are what bind us as a community and they serve as the foundation for a common language._We selected Melissa to be a Featured Athlete because we recognized how a structured plan and accountability would benefit someone who already possessed the amount discipline, determination and courage that Melissa does. Training for and running the Berlin Marathon is but one step in Melissa’s overall journey as a runner. This episode celebrates this moment in her journey. It was an honor to offer our experience and suggestions. Thank you and congratulations, Melissa. The TCS New York City Marathon is nine days away. To celebrate the beginning of race week, Chill Track Friday sat down with Michael Capiraso, President and C.E.O. of New York Road Runners, to discuss all things marathon, and all things Michael. Whether you are running the marathon this year, cheering, have run the race before, or aspire to be among the field in the future, this episode will energize you for the greatest marathon in the world, taking place next Sunday, November 3rd._This episode is also about Michael’s journey. Michael ran his first New York City Marathon in 1991. He has toed the line every year since. Michael’s story illustrates the beauty in taking risks and how by putting one foot in front of the other we can open our lives to growth, opportunity, and helping others along the way. For Michael, like many runners, the marathon changed his life. His ongoing relationship with the distance continues to brighten his life every year. This episode will encourage you to challenge yourself beyond your comfort zone and to embrace the unknown. What better way to do so than at the TCS New York City Marathon. Sid Howard ran his first marathon in 1978 at the age of 39. He ran eight more marathons until finally deciding to forego the distance in order to focus on racing the mile. This decision allowed his talent to truly shine. Over a long career, Sid continued to surpass his own performances. Sid has earned over fifty National masters titles, six U.S. records, five world records, eight world championship medals, and in 2005 he was inducted into the USATF Masters Hall of Fame. Sid holds American indoor records for M65-69 of 2:19.4 for the 800m, 5:23.05 for the mile, and 4:45.36 for 1500m.
Behind these accolades is a grateful man who loves life and who loves to share his enthusiasm for running with those around him. Sid is a mentor, coach, inspiration, and ambassador of the sport. He is a beautiful story-teller with a well of wisdom and experience. More than winning any particular race or record, Sid’s story is about the power of persistence, determination, and hard work. It is a story about the twisting turns of life and how the skills gained in athletic training can bleed into other areas of life. Sid embodies joyful living and joyful running. This episode is a privilege to share, thank you, Sid."

Club Vida 10,"Mi nombre es Miquel Gironès y quiero darte la bienvenida al podcast de la primera Universidad de Hábitos Online en español.Formo parte de un grupo de personas obsesionadas con mejorar sus vidas, sentirse mejor consigo mismas y cumplir metas y sueños considerados irrealizables o imposibles para otros. Un grupo de personas de los que quizás no hayas oído hablar ya que nosotros vivimos, como nosotros decimos, como los bambús: ponemos Focus en echar raíces y cuando la base es sólida, crecemos más rápido que ninguna otra planta.Nosotros hemos entendido antes que nadie el potencial y el mecanismo de funcionamiento de los hábitos para crear nuevas realidades, ser dueños de nuestro propio futuro y arquitectos de nuestras vidas.Hemos roto falsas creencias como que adelgazar tiene que ser a base de sacrificio y pasar hambre o que está reservado a unos pocos privilegiados con fuerza de voluntad excepcional o buena genética.Ahora miramos de tú a tú a empresas del mundo de la nutrición, el coaching y el fitness con presupuestos literalmente ilimitados, y esto nos ha hecho conquistar nuestra propia libertad, crear un nuevo movimiento, crear una nueva filosofía de vida.Con una metodología que desde luego no te enseñan en costosos másters, universidades desconectadas de este nuevo mercado o consultas de nutricionistas y profesionales de la salud tradicionales.Mientras en el siglo XX lo que se valoraba eran los títulos y las dietas de fotocopia como única forma de mejorar la salud y la energía de las personas que querían un cambio en sus vidas, el siglo XXI es la era de los expertos y nosotros ya lo somos. El futuro es de los expertos que pueden probar los resultados de sus clientes con datos reales y objetivos.Y es la era del apoyo mutuo y de hacer piña: andar sola/o por este camino de cambio es cosa del pasado. Con internet, la inteligencia colectiva de un grupo unido para la misma meta es una fuerza imparable.Somos Lifers, y eso implica que somos más rápidos, más inteligentes, más constantes y más libres. Pero sobre todo implica que tenemos la misión de ser focos de cambio para nosotros y para los demás; nosotros definimos nuestro propio futuro, construimos nuestra propia suerte y creamos nuestra propia realidad.Vamos allá. ¡Bienvenido al pódcast del Club Vida 10!

Every week you will enjoy Jason Glass's unique brand of Edutainment (Education through Entertainment). Join the community and get inspired! Maximize your potential and those around you! Dream Big & Over Deliver! Andrew Putnam is this week’s guest. If you are a fan of golf you will know that Andrew is a PGA Tour winner and #1 putter in the world. His success is founded in perpetual growth in all aspects of his life. Spiritual, mental, physical, emotional and relationships. I am very fortunate to have the opportunity to coach Andrew over the past 6 years but even more grateful for his friendship and the lessons he has taught me over this span. Enjoy! There are highs and lows along their path to greatness. Great coaches can identify and in many cases predict the dips in performance and plateaus and have the skill set to right the ship and efficiently get it back on the path. Some people think that great coaching takes technical skills, great eye for detail and a confident motivating presence. I think great coaching requires empathy, vulnerability and sincerity. But what do I know? If you are an athlete, injuries are inevitable. You may feel invincible but there is an injury in the mail, it just hasn’t reached you yet! If you want to minimize the affect of your injuries you need to truly understand what your injury is, how to treat it and when to return to battle. Once you understand what the injury is, you can decide the best way to treat it. Every New Year I perform an action that sets my year up for success.  I erase the entire hard drive on my computer and phone.  I know, I know, I know it sounds crazy!  Take a breathe and release your puckered balloon knot for a minute and let me explain.  What I am about to present to you isn’t just for your computer but for all aspects of your life! We go DEEP into rate of force, range of motion and how reducing one can increase the other and create amazing power gains. We talk speed, technique and long held myths about strength training. My favourite part of our conversations, always revolve around what it means to be a coach. We talk about our mentors and Al shares a story that will break your heart and inspire you to be a better coach! To all my Glisten’s around the globe....Happy Holidays! This annual Holiday Special is my way of sharing a Christmas Cheer with all of you. Every week we get to enjoy a coffee together but during the Holiday season my good friend Santa puts a little something special in my mug! I wish you all a fantastic holiday with your friends and family. If you have neither, you can rest your head on Christmas Eve knowing that you have a family here with the #GlistenerNation."
Coach Sean Fitness Podcast,"Covering all things health and fitness, this podcast aims to give you real, actionable advice that the everyday person can apply to their lifestyle. Short 25-30 minute episodes, covering one new topic each week, will drop every Wednesday. #LetsGoGetEmAgain In this episode of the Coach Seán Fitness Podcast, I talk about overcoming a fear of failure. ""I have failed over and over again. And that is why I succeed"" - Michael Jordan. 

This podcast has always been intended to help those that want to have a work/life balance for fitness and everything else. It's not directed at athletes or those that live in the gym. 

Especially in the last 6 months, I have struggled with that balance which I talked about feeling hypocritical in episode 18 (#18: Getting Back On Track). So I made the decision to make quite a few changes in my life, a lot of which take effect this weekend. Which meant this was supposed to be a short podcast - I wasn't expecting 25 minutes. 

The other reason, I set up this own podcast was to get over my fear of failing (and actually failing on numerous occasions) in public speaking. Trying to be clear and articulate my words for what I want to get across has been a struggle. And I feel talking about that may help someone listening make a leap to try something new in the health and fitness field.

I then talk about my 6 ""hacks"" for fitness eBook. You can find the eBook by going to CoachSeanC.com on the home page for an in-depth look. The 6 ""hacks"" are anything but hacks. They are principles I apply to my own health and fitness that I feel lead to long term, sustainable results. Focus on one thing over the next month and dedicate yourself to being better at that. By focusing on too many, you'll become overwhelmed. Some of which I have talked about a few times in the previous 19 episodes. 

Hit me up on Instagram, @coach_seanc, on your thoughts on this week's episode. 

https://www.instagram.com/coach_seanc/ With week 3 underway of 2020, the motivation starts to drop and more people start to either fall off the wagon or look for a quick fix to their goals.

And that's where people can become over-reliant on the possibility of supplements.

In this episode, I go through potential supplements you could be taking, with the caveat that they ""supplement"" a healthy lifestyle (with the exception to a ""superhero"" supplement from Web MD that I know, or am pretty sure anyway, that I will never need. 

While I think I hammered home the point that you need to put in the work to get results and some supplements should be viewed as an addition rather than a miracle drug, I forgot to emphasis that they are potentially necessary for those with a very hectic lifestyle that don't have a chance to sit and eat good quality food for large chunks of the day. 

In particular, in this episode, we talk a little about Fish Oils, Magnesium and Vitamin D. Also, the idea behind a little info to this supplements is something that may potentially help a little with your health and fitness lifestyle. If you feel like you have a serious nutrition issue, I would recommend going straight to a dietician on exact levels that suit you. 

Plus why I HATE the idea of ""Blue Monday""

#LetsGoGetEmAgain The title can refer to myself getting back on track for the Coach Seán Fitness Podcast as well as getting back on track with goals for 2020.

After nearly 2 hours of Mac uploads, only to find there was a fault in the wire of the mic I was using, I finally get the first podcast of 2020 recorded. 

In this episode, we are talking about:

- Why I feel like a hypocrite with how 2019 ended for me personally.
- Looking back at the previous year before committing the new goals in 2020
- How to be more specific with your goals in 2020
- Why the next trendy go-to diet may not be the answer for you to achieve your fat loss goals in 2020.

Yes, with it being the New Year, '2020' is mentioned quite a bit and surprisingly, talk about my 49ers is left to the last minute of the show. Just a little heads up for you!

Apologies for no shows over the last 3 weeks. But with this one done, I feel like I'm back in the saddle again and good to go for this year... 2020

Plus check out my new Podcast, Any Given Runday, for those of you who have running as a priority in 2020 In this week's episode, I talk briefly about my fitness journey and the mistakes I made when I first started going to the gym. There is too much to mention in this 20-minute podcast but a lot of those mistakes are what I am currently seeing people doing today.

Going from doing a lot of sports, to trying to find void for missing them and the competitiveness it brings and then joining the gym only to eventually lose motivation to either injury or life getting more hectic with work, family commitments etc. - if this sounds like you, then this is definitely the podcast episode for you! 

I also talk about what should be in your gym programme: Squat, Hinge, Lunge, Carry, Upper Body Push and Pull. 

And if the programming sounds too much for you to work around, I can make it a lot easier for you! My 8 Week Fitness &amp; Fat Loss Transformation Challenge is starting on Monday, January 6th. Start your fitness goals for 2020 STRONG! Check out the link below for more details:

#LetsGoGetEmAgain While doing some research on this week's newsletter, I came across the Peloton Controversy in the States. There was an uproar over their Christmas ad, that you can check out through the link below:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pShKu2icEYw

I had originally wanted to talk about Christmas gifts from a health &amp; fitness perspective and expand on the blog below:

http://www.coachseanc.com/blog/2019/11/28/christmasblack-friday-gift-ideas

But I wanted to address this. One of the issues with the ad (besides the sexism) is that a husband bought the wife the peloton bike because he thinks that she needs to work out when, looking at her, she is definitely not overweight.

This is where I have a huge problem. Being in the gym or taking up any form of exercise should not be determined whether someone else thinks you need it for appearance. If you want to work out because you want to lose a few pounds, great! Go for it and try to better yourself for you.

But that's far from the only health benefit to training. You cannot judge a person's fitness levels by their size. Although BMI would tell you that Usain Bolt is barely in the normal range while pretty much all rugby players and bodybuilders like Arnold Schwarzenegger would be obese. Is The Rock obese? Despite being a better metric than the scales, the BMI chart is still a poor form of metric for healthy bodyweights. 

But besides all that, when we train we feel better. Do I feel better when I'm going through a great run of training sessions and consistent with my diet 80% of the time? Yes! I feel great when I'm leaner. But I also have more energy. I am more mentally alert. A lot of my ideas come from jogging on the road or in the gym. I truly feel it is a form of stress relief and meditation. 

It is also the cheapest form of medicine. So when people start giving out about ads like this because they think it implies that the person is exercising due to weight and that she should be accepted for who she is, it shows a poor understanding of the many reasons why someone would want to take up a fitness regime! 

It is so much more about overall health and fitness. And regardless of starting weight, it can be ""life-changing"". 

www.CoachSeanC.com Head shaving and Christmas decorations have one common thing in problem that's been giving me an awful head this past week. 

But with the exception of that rant, it's straight into some practical health and fitness advice from the 6th minute of the podcast where we talk about:

- Why you shouldn't go cold turkey (pun most definitely intended and disgusted with myself that I did not use it on the podcast)  on your fitness before Christmas
- How a negative mindset and Mr Miyagi lead to a terrible outcome... and how I just had to own that outcome. 
- Tha Coach Sean Advent Christmas Challenge (as well as my two Christmas gym programmes available through http://eepurl.com/ckeVyL)
- Just what the hell ""adaptive thermogenesis"" is and why you should have more protein which is not bad for you if you have healthy kidneys.

Coached By Harris,"Together we are going to bust common “myths,” have crucial conversations and create actionable steps for you to evolve old perspectives and make the mental and physical progress that you are after. A quick 5 minutes that will impact your future in fitness. In this episode, I discuss why fitness goes so much deeper than just the way you look. If you are struggling to make progress or enjoy the process, listen closely and dig deep into your own “Why.” Here we talk about the idea that something is always better than nothing and that the all or nothing mindset is outdated. A brief intro into this topic, I discuss why there truly is no best option when it comes to nutrition and exercise. Find what works for you and what you can sustain. In Episode 001 of my podcast, I discuss practical ways to actually appreciate the small daily wins that will occur in your fitness journey, whether you now realize them or not. I also discuss why Doing this is crucial to your current and future success."

Coaches on Couches,"Each week Coach D and Coach B-Fun share their 20+ years of endurance coaching, training and racing experience through less than serious conversations and interviews with other time crunched athletes, coaches, and  experts within the endurance community. If you are a cyclist, triathlete, runner, or do-it-all athlete, this is made for you! We can't guarantee political correctness, but we can guarantee you will pull some great nuggets of information to help improve your own performance.We'll be talking: Cycling, Running, Triathlon, Duathlon, Cross Country, Aquabike, SwimRun, Mountain Biking, Cyclocross, Gravel Grinders, and any other sports we have the pleasure of working with. This episode is less on performance enhancement and more on enhancing the experience of training and racing. We recently purchased a couple of adventure vans build by the good people at VanDOit in Blue Springs, MO. The truth is we did a ton of research before pulling the trigger and spending our hard earned dollars with VanDOit. But for every cyclist, runner, or triathlete, a camper van or adventure van can make an otherwise awesome adventure, epic. We talk about why we wanted adventure vans, why we chose VanDOit, some of the must have items in the build, and some places we are excited about going this year in these rigs.
 Lastly, we chat a little about a new venture that came out of all of this. Our plan is to rent our vans so others can make memories and have some really awesome outdoor experiences. No fluff, just being in nature, staying fit, and spending time with friends and family. What else do you really need?
 So if the athlete van life has interested you, check out this episode of Coaches on Couches!

 Good Luck: Camp Shelby Gravel Grind Dirty Kanza Lottery In this episode we chat about the pros and cons of choosing to coach yourself, versus choosing a free or paid training plan, versus hiring a coach. There are a lot of factors that go into choosing which is best for you. Things like budget, spare time, and the learning curve of each will play a big role on the route you should go. So if you are a cyclist, triathlete, or runner staring down a big season with big goals, and don't have a road map yet, join us for another round of Coaches on Couches. Some cyclist, runners, and triathletes just are not morning people. Which is odd, because most races start at the butt crack of dawn. But generally speaking, if you don't knock out some training in the early morning, the chances of it happening diminish with every hour that passes. So on this episode we are going to give you some tips and methods on how you can change and create new routines that can lead to the incredibly efficient and productive habit of....getting your butt out of bed. Back by popular demand we are dropping our 2019 holiday gifts for the cyclist, runner, or triathlete in your life. Or just something nice for yourself. We all know that's why you'll listen. We break the gifts down by price point starting at the sub $20 mark. Each coach gives their recommendations for things they personally use and love so you are sure to score brownie points with any of these ideas. We threw in a few shameless plugs so forgive us.

Confidently Uncomfortable with J.Go,"Hey love! What’s up?! Welcome to Confidently Uncomfortable. I’m your host J.Go- health & lifestyle coach and not-so-regal confidence queen. Coming at you with the REAL, the Raw and of course, the UNCOMFORTABLE. My mission is to show you- that to be confident, it has absolutely NOTHING to do with being perfect or having it “all together” and EVERYTHING to do with getting UNCOMFORTABLE and pushing your limits. Tune in as I share my own stories, experiences and education as well as connect with other confident and inspiring guests. INCLUDING YOU! I'll be sharing your stories & confidence wins as you listen along and gain the courage to send them my way!Every week, I’ll be showing up here - real and raw - even when it’s uncomfortable.You’ll be getting expert information about what it takes to show up & be the BEST version of you! It’s normal to not always feel confident in yourself and how you look, BUT what we do with those feelings can make a difference. I want to help you take those feelings and turn them into something positive and uplifting!   We all want to feel POWERFUL, CONFIDENT, and STRONG. Too often we connect that with a number on a scale but that’s simply not true. The truth is your confidence was taken from you and I’m going to tell you how to get it back.  Setting goals can be so empowering but we (myself included) fall into some mistakes that keep us from crushing those goals. I'm diving into some common mistakes I’ve made and see my clients making while setting goals, but don’t worry I’m not just going to leave you there! I will also be going into what you should be doing instead to show up, take action, and crush your goals.    It’s not just about the vision but the ACTION steps behind it. This episode is all about the things to LET GO from 2019 and things to ADD to 2020. I’m sharing what I plan on adding and letting go, but also giving you action steps to figure out what it is you need to let go or add for 2020! Self care is more than face masks and bath bombs, it’s checking in with you, simply put self care is self love. It’s time to get out of the mindset that self love is selfish and start taking care of YOU.  In this episode I'm talking about all things self love, from deciding how people treat you to how you treat yourself.  This video MAY piss some people off but it HAS to be said.

There is a DISCONNECT between the body positive movement AND diet culture. It’s time to break up with fad diets and your ideas of what is right or wrong in body positivity. In this episode I’m diving into how you can show up for yourself in the best possible way because of what YOU need or want. "

Conversations for Yoga Teachers,"Designed to share yoga teaching related topics in the areas of technique as well as personal and professional development. Think of it like having a cup a tea and a chat with a colleague yoga teacher! So, here we are, at the third in my FOUR episode series all about anatomical based cues and more importantly how knowing these can transform your teaching. If you’re made it this far, I know you’re interested but what if you’re stuck and feeling unwilling to change. Maybe you figure, “What’s the impact of keeping things as they are?” Here I lay that out for you. Remember to tune in tomorrow for the last episode in this series! Here’s the second episode in my series of FOUR (E 53, 54, 55 and 56) that ALL go together, laying out for you background on why CUES, specifically ANATOMY based cues are so powerful to use and why learning the WHY behind the cue can transform your teaching! Remember to stay tuned for the next two episodes for how this ALL fits together! If you’re a yoga teacher, what’s the ONE BIG THING you want to learn more about? Well, listen to this podcast episode, the first in a series of 4, and I’ll share what I’ve learned by talking to dozens of teachers over the years!Remember, this is one of FOUR episodes that all go together. Don’t miss out on the next one too! Looking for a fun and interesting personal development exercise? Grab a journal and a cup of tea and get ready to do a deep dive on yourself! This can be a powerful first step in bringing to the surface the self limiting beliefs and stories that are holding you back from being an authentic teacher, one who teaches with presence and clarity and one who is endlessly curious and open to growth. What does having integrity as a teacher mean? Showing up to your class on time? Being dependable? Well, yes those things are true but it’s so much more. And why does it matter? Listen to my latest episode for this special theme.
In this episode I refer to an amazing opportunity. which is my annual mentorship program. To find out more, click here:
https://barebonesyoga.lpages.co/yoga-teacher-coaching-program/ Listen to this episode as close to the start of 2020 as possible (if you can) to get the most out of it.

Crazy Does It,"On this show, I interview inspiring endurance athletes who will give you motivation and a little nudge to get you through your next tough training session. Keely Brown is about to take part in a 49-day, 4,000-mile relay run across the US to support young adults &amp; their loved ones who have been diagnosed with cancer.

In this conversation, Keely shared about her running journey, how she’s preparing for running nearly 500 miles over 49-days while staying injury-free, and how running has truly changed her life and brought her courage and joy. Whether you’re a seasoned runner or just starting out, I think you’re going to enjoy this conversation with Keely. Danielle Kissel (muddywarriorchick.com) calls herself a runner, an obstacle course racer, and a lifter of heavy things. While she considers herself an elite, ultra runner athlete, her mindset is 100% family and team related.

On the weekends, you can find her running around trail and obstacle course races, but when she’s not racing or training, she’s working her full-time job as a graphic and web designer, and she’s also in grad school pursuing an M.S. in Cybersecurity.  Amy Claire Patterson did not grow up as a runner or endurance athlete. It wasn’t until just a couple of years ago that she completed her first race.

Amy Claire now serves as Team World Vision Indy Area Director at World Vision USA. During this episode, she shares about the mission of World Vision as well as how she’s gone from not being athletic to running marathons and even climbing Mount Kilimanjaro where she successfully summited this past summer just a few months after breaking her foot. In this episode, we talk about how Matt dreamed up this crazy idea of running across the Grand Canyon and back and how he and 2 of his closest friends are joining him for this feat. While it may seem like a simple enough goal - there is a LOT that goes into preparing for something like a 50-odd mile run with 20,000 feet of elevation change.

Matt hasn’t completed his goal just yet, but we talk ALL of the details and how he’s preparing both physically and mentally for this crazy challenge. Bobby Grangier had never completed a full Ironman-Distance triathlon… until the Norseman Xtreme Triathlon. He put his name in the draw thanks to the promoting of his coach, and against all odds, won a slot. 

Bobby and I talk about his journey into triathlon, how he prepared for the Norseman while living in the middle of the US, and how he conquered his first Ironman-distance triathlon and took home the coveted black tee shirt. Taren Gesell (Triathlon Taren) hasn’t always been the Speedo-clad, All-World Ironman triathlete, and IRONMAN U Certified Coach and ISSA Certified Specialist in Sports Nutrition you see today.

A decade ago, Taren was unhealthy and unhappy. Today, he has made triathlon a way of life, having competed in countless races. 

It’s his passion to bring age-group triathletes tips on healthy living and training which he does through his YouTube Channel, top-rated Podcast, and triathlon-specific books."

Create Your Now Archive 6 with Kristianne Wargo,"Create Your Now (Archive 6) brings moms, mompreneurs, and entrepreneurs tools and strategies to become their best selfie in areas of lifestyle, business, spirituality, nutrition, fitness, parenting, relationships, motherhood, mindset and balanced daily living. We promise according to our hopes; And perform according to our fears! This 7-day a week podcast will empower and encourage you to rediscover, rejuvenate and renew who you are in mind, body, and spirit. Topics include healthy living, work life balance, weight loss, exercise videos, overcoming adversity, burnout, inspiration, motivation, cooking and recipes, mind mapping, goal setting, marriage difficulties and Christian values. Let's train for life and love your journey. Be Present. Be Incredible. Be YOU!!! When you shop for your fruits and vegetables, what is the dirty dozen? Is it something to hide from, or can you eat them anyway?
 The Dirty Dozen™ is an annual report released by EWG (Environmental Working Group) which ranks conventional (non-organic) fruits and vegetables based on the amount of pesticide residue found on each one.
 Desire to be supported and encourage by other like-minded women? Join us at Women of IMPACT. http://facebook.com/groups/thewomenofimpact
 This is approximately 40,000 washed produce samples that are tested by the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) and the FDA (Food and Drug Administration).
 So what made the Dirty Dozen™ list?
  Strawberries Spinach Kale Nectarines Apples Grapes Peaches Cherries Pears Tomatoes Celery Potatoes  Now there is also the Clean Fifteen™. These are the fruits and vegetables with the least amount of pesticide residue.
  Avocados Sweet Corn* Pineapples Sweet Peas Frozen Onions Papayas* Eggplants Asparagus Kiwis Cabbages Cauliflower Cantaloupes Broccoli Mushrooms Honeydew Melons  * A small amount of sweet corn, papaya and summer squash sold in the United States is produced from genetically modified seeds. Buy organic varieties of these crops if you want to avoid genetically modified produce.
 The K.I.S.S. ~ Know what you eat!  Establish a budget. This gives you a clear guideline as to how much you can spend and then you can prioritize accordingly. Shop in season; and locally like farmers' markets. This will help to reduce the cost because it's in season. Also, shopping locally helps to reduce the cost, plus you know where your food is coming from. Adjust for the must-haves. If your family has their heart set on certain fruits or vegetables, you can buy according to their wishes keeping in mind the Dirty Dozen™ or the Clean Fifteen™.  BONUS: If you don't eat the outside or the skin, you can purchase the less expensive fruits and vegetables. If you do eat the outside, then consider the Dirty Dozen™ list and make the appropriate decision for you and your family.
 There is no right or wrong way to eat. However, when you understand how to stretch a budget and eat the healthiest foods, your mind and body will thank you!

 Life is already jam-packed with stuff to do. Your response to the ""How are you?"" in passing, is you yelling out, ""B-U-S-Y!"".
 You only have 168 hours a week to get done what you want. If you take away your guaranteed sleep time of 7 hours a day, that leaves only 119 hours to do everything else. And that includes going to the bathroom.
 There is an old saying that has been used by leaders of the past who have great achievements (like The founder of the Roman Empire, Augustus). The Latin phrase was Festina Lente.
 The translation is ""Make haste, slowly.""
 It's also been translated in English to ""more haste, less speed"".
 Life isn't about rushing through the moments. Life is being in the moment; being!
 The K.I.S.S. ~ Go slow to go fast! When we take our time, it doesn't mean we are moving too slowly or that we don't know what we're doing.
 The pace in which you travel on your journey is yours to set. You can choose to walk to the town you want to go. Or you can take a bus, drive a car, or fly on a plane.
 All different ways will get you to where you want to go, but some will allow you to take in the sites, see the world as you travel. While others will get you there fastest by leaving everything in between where you are to where you are headed, in the dust.
 The question is how much are you willing to miss to get where you are going?
 Life is a marathon; a journey worth savoring and impacting!

 Is there peace and comfort in the truth you seek? Or are these labels thrust upon you that which you accept as truth?
 Desire to be supported and encourage by other like-minded women? Join us at Women of IMPACT. http://facebook.com/groups/thewomenofimpact
 People may see you one way, and yet, you see yourself another. But which one carries more value?
 Unfortunately, we depend more upon what others see within ourselves. What others think to carry more value.
 Now I get it! You want to believe yourself more. You try to convince yourself otherwise.
 But that's when the perfection curse takes over. You want others to see what you see. And when they don't, you typically side with your accusers; the ones who thrust their labels upon you.
 Then it happens. You now are responsible and carry the liability of those labels. Not only are you accused of something that may or may not be true, but you are slammed with the imprisonment of what those labels do to you.
 Your days are confined to what you believe is true based on others' labels.
 Maybe you were not enough. Maybe you failed more than you succeeded. Maybe you gave up too easily. Maybe you quit too many times. Maybe you aren't organized. Maybe you weigh too much. Maybe you don't finish anything.
 All of these maybes ring true in your head. And when you believe something, you accept the responsibility for those trues. Hence, the liability.
 Keep in mind, these labels only become truths if they are true, and you believe them to be so.
 But you don't have to accept the labels or the liability. You can instead live the life between labels and liability.
 However, you have to be willing to create a space for truth.
 The K.I.S.S. ~ Create a ""garden"" for truth! You want to grow only the truths you want in your life. You want to be able to get rid of the weeds. And then you want to fertilize that in which you want to blossom.
  Adopt the truth, the foundation: You are fearfully and wonderfully made. (Psalm 139:14) Is the label true? If yes, then what can you change/improve. If no, then let go of the label. Take the truths and multiple their strengths.  Labels can sting. Liability can keep you stuck and hold you back from your purpose.
 Look in the mirror and see what God sees. Be open to growing as He stretches you. Be cautious of those who sling labels left and right, as they care very little and invest nothing in whom you are. Don't let your path be defined by the liability of these labels.
 Instead, move forward with a pace that keeps you in line with the strength of your heart.

 Click he The pace of your journey is met by the strength of your heart. Step into your purpose and learn how to grow in your faith.
 You are called to step out in faith. And faith not given by your own doings. Your deeds do not get the job done.

 But we think they do.
 How fast are you running from your life? Are you just trying to keep your head barely above water?
 The biggest obstacles in life is overcoming oneself; getting out of the way so God can step up His maneuvers.
 God sets boundaries to not only keep us safe, but to keep us focused and directed where He desires us to go.
 ""God is an indescribable and incredible planner.""
 And in that, you are called to step out in faith.
 But in stepping out in faith, it is expected that we are to grow in our faith.
 Yet what happens when you don't get your way with God?
 You lose faith!
 When you step out in faith, you get jolts of overwhelm and fear, because you may not know the reasoning behind His direction. God doesn't always share His heavenly planner.
 As you learn and lean on God, that causes you to become more vulnerable with Him. You grow in your intimacy with God. Which in turn, increases the level of trust.
 ""Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct your paths."" ~ Proverbs 3:5-6  It's up to you to fit into God's plan instead of trying to make God fit into your plan.
 ""God writes straight with crocked lines."" ~ Portuguese Proverb
 The K.I.S.S. ~ Grow in your faith! When you are desiring to grow in your faith, it takes forsaking all and trusting in Him.
 Faith is spelled F-A-I-T-H.
 ""Forsaking All, I Trust Him.""
 If you are willing to give up everything and trust God, you are acting in obedience.
 So, how do you grow in your faith?
 Obedience.
 Don't put a limit on your life nor your hopes. Let God set the boundaries and lead the way. That's living a limitless life with God and growing in your faith.
 In this season of your life, are you growing in your faith? Are you creating space for God to show up so you can walk in faith?
 Your obedience is your faith metric.
 How much are you willing to give up in order to grow in your faith?
 This is only a question you can answer.
 Be prayerful today in the way you should go. Ask God to join you in your faith walk.
 The pace of your journey is met by the strength of your heart. Allow God to build your faith through your obedience.
 ""One step at a time leads to miles of greatness. Walk by faith; forsaking all, I trust Him!""

 Read more from Kristi One of the hallmarks of a loving relationship is giving up something for the sake of your partner. Is marriage worth the sacrifice?
 You giving up something for the one you love. All of that time and energy spent on what he wants instead of doing what you want.
 Desire to be supported and encourage by other like-minded women? Join us at Women of IMPACT. http://facebook.com/groups/thewomenofimpact
 Initially, that sounds crazy! Why would you want to give up something?
 Shouldn't you be the priority first and then consider the other one?
 Well, I guess it depends on who you ask and the timing of the question.
 If a marriage is happy and all is going well, it doesn't sound bad at all giving up something. But when your marriage is on rocky ground, like a fight just happened, you may not want to even consider that possibility.
 Sacrifice is one of the purest ways to show your love.
 We are reminded of this from how God sent his only Son to die on the cross for you and me.
 He could of done something totally different. However, He wanted to show us what sacrifice truly meant; giving up of oneself.
 Now, I'm not saying you need to go a literally sacrifice your life.
 But take God's lead in your marriage.
 Sacrifice shows you are willing to pay a price; a way to show you care above anything else.
 If marriage is worth the sacrifice, then how do you do it.
 You want to create a pattern of giving.
 The K.I.S.S. ~ Create a pattern of giving! And notice, it's a pattern of giving, not giving up. Love requires us to give. Give when we don't want to. Give when we are tired. Give when we are crabby. Give when we are happy.
 It's going beyond what we feel like we can do at the time. Sacrifice may bring discomfort to you in the short term, but in the long term, the benefits far outweigh the immediate discomfort.
 What does a pattern of giving look like?
  Trade your comfort for your spouse's comfort. Let your words be giving. (how you phrase your requests, how you express your emotions, etc.) Let your actions speak louder than your words.  This is just the beginning of you sacrificing in your marriage.
 There are so many things you can do. Things that you think are so simple, can be so big and impactful.
 Don't wait to show your love!
 ""Your marriage is worth the sacrifice! Are you ready to give?""

  https://journal.thriveglobal.com/how-to-configure-a-slee Children have a way with words when they want something. We say one thing, but they yell another. ""Don't talk to me like that!""

 Maybe it's been a long week. Not everything has worked out the way you or your child hoped. There's a little extra stress in the air you breathe.
 For just a moment, you feel that what you say is more important than the whining or frustrated child waiting for you to be quiet.
 ""I'm going to scream a little louder. You need to hear what I have to say whether you want to or not.""
 Children need to listen and hear their mommas clearly. Not ranting and raving just because. But sharing her wisdom as only you can.
 Maybe you can recall a time driving in the car and your child was misbehaving in the back. At some point, you yell out... If you don't stop this right now, I'm gonna come back there.
 There is a Greek word, Epitimaō, and it means to command with an implication of a threat.
 Your children need to hear your love exclaimed through words that can be threatening. And that threat is simply due to the fact they don't want to hear it.
 You're not saying it to hurt them, but to help.
 We need to stop putting ourselves in the backseat and stand up for our children by sharing our wisdom.
 Epitimaō
 It's been a long week! When you're tired, you don't always make good decisions.
 And my children tested me on some of the decisions they were making. They challenged me on how much do I allow them to grow up on their own verses assisting them with clear, concise wisdom to change their direction.
 ""There is a time to be silent and a time to speak."" ~ Ecclesiastes 3:7 (NIV) However, a lot of us lean more toward the silent. It's easier and there's less yelling.
 Today I want to encourage you to stand up for your child.
 The K.I.S.S. ~ Let your wisdom be heard! Let your wisdom be heard. You don't need to silent yourself from your children.
 Your knowledge is a gift to your child. They might not see it at first, but stand proudly. You are doing right by them in sharing that wisdom.
 And yes, that means putting your foot down at times.
 Drawing the line in the sand and saying NO loudly!
 It won't be easy when they disagree. But know in your heart that if God shares His wisdom, you are to share yours.
 ""There is a time to be silent and a time to speak. Let your wisdom be heard!""

Crohn's Fitness Food,"Crohn’s Fitness Food Podcast is dedicated to raising awareness, sharing IBD stories, and offering support for those with Crohn’s & Colitis. If you’re going through your own IBD journey or are a family member supporting someone with this disease, I hope you find inspiration, confidence, and community through this podcast. Together we can share knowledge, experiences, and help show the world the many faces of IBD. In today’s episode, Crohn’s Warrior and food challenge competitor, Michael Simmons, shares his IBD story. From his first Crohn’s symptoms in 2008 to his ileostomy surgery in 2017, he’s now not only raising awareness for ostomy patients, but also raising the bar for eating without a colon.
From Remicade infusions that put him into anaphylactic shock to medical marijuana, Michael talks about the various treatment options he’s tried and what led to his decision to finally have his ileostomy surgery. He tried various diets over the years, from the Specific Carbohydrate Diet to the Low FODMAP Diet, in combination with medications, but never reached remission.
During his hospital stay after his ileostomy surgery in 2017, Michael had the idea to start doing food challenges. Having had such a restrictive diet over the years, it was a fun way to start enjoying food again and to show others that surgery didn’t mean continued sacrifice with food. He immediately began advocating for ostomy patients and started his Instagram account to show what life after an ostomy was like and to raise the bar for eating without a colon.
Just five months after his surgery, Michael did his first food challenge. Since then, he’s been documenting his #bagvsfood challenges. From giant stacks of pancakes, burritos, and pizza to the Lulu’s “Texas Ranger” Chicken Fried Steak Challenge right before his interview with me, he’s showing that an ostomy doesn’t have to hinder life. Though he doesn’t let anything stop him from trying a food challenge, there are a few obstacles that are difficult to overcome. Speed eating is off the table, since it’s critical to chew food with an ostomy, and he always listens to his body. The goal, he says, is to have fun, not end up in the emergency room.
Surgery has given him control of his life and put food back on the table! In addition to his Instagram, Michael has just started a YouTube Channel to go into greater detail about ostomy life and even document his food challenges.

---Episode support:Cellercise Rebounder: https://www.crohnsfitnessfood.com/cellerciseIntestinal Fortitude Supplements: https://www.crohnsfitnessfood.com/if (10% OFF use code CFF10) Describing her Instagram as “a young gal’s adventures with Crohn’s Disease &amp; other chronic illnesses,” Renee Taylor continues her IBD advocacy on today’s podcast where she shares her Crohn’s journey and how she’s seeking to find the balance between western and holistic medicine.
Diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease while a junior in college, Renee shares her many ups and downs over the past two years. Renee was diagnosed with Autoimmune Hepatitis as a child, so she’s no stranger to battling chronic illness. But, since being diagnosed with IBD, she’s faced some of her biggest challenges yet, including flare-ups and erythema nodosum episodes that are so severe that she can’t walk.
Renee talks about her medication history, from her first few (and only) days on prednisone to finding immediate relief with Remicade. But relief was short lived as she failed out after a few months and then switched to Humira. Once again, however, she started to reject Humira and it was then, around July 2019, that she decided to get serious about her lifestyle and began focusing on changing her diet and reducing her stress levels to help manage Crohn’s.
While fitness has always been a part of Renee’s life, she stresses the importance of re-evaluating what fitness looks like after being diagnosed with IBD. As she describes in the interview, sometimes fitness must be put on hold during intense flares. She talks about how she’s learned to celebrate the small daily victories and reminds herself that the flares are temporary. Overall, she feels better when she gives her body the chance to sweat and move and fitness gives a much-needed routine and structure to life with a chronic illness.
During flares, she tries to hold on to a sense of normalcy, even if it’s just reading a book or connecting with a friend. She’s learned to adapt her diet to include foods she tolerates and avoid common inflammatory foods like corn, soy, and gluten. Renee has also found the power of investing in her interests and not being afraid to follow her passions, one of which is advocating for IBD patients.
Through her advocacy, she has found a sense of normalcy and connection to those fighting the same battles. This month, she’s starting a collaboration with Avery Rosenbloom from @talktummytome on Instagram called “What the F Wednesdays.” They’ll be diving into the abyss that is early adulthood in a series of Instagram live videos. The first episode just launched yesterday, January 5th, on her Instagram (@killinitwithcrohns) and future episodes will be recorded every Wednesday evening.

Pineapple Clothing Leggings: https://www.crohnsfitnessfood.com/pineapple(20% OFF with code: STEGIS) In today’s episode, Stella Rose Carr shares how she’s managed to keep a positive outlook and a good sense of humor while battling Crohn’s Disease for most of her life. Officially diagnosed at eight years old, she recalls what it was like to face her first colonoscopy as a child and how IBD impacted her life from elementary school through college.
At 13 years old, she had six inches of her small intestine removed. While things did improve after that, she still found herself sick often from a compromised immune system. Stella opens up and talks about her recent decision to come off of the Humira she was taking in order to try different medications that could offer less frequent injections. Her body struggled for about a year when she switched from Humira to Stelara and she eventually went back to Humira, without the same relief as before, and is now hoping to find remission with Entivyo.
Still battling flare ups and symptoms, Stella shares how she’s been able to keep both her sense of humor and overall positive outlook while battling Crohn’s. She gives a lot of credit to The Painted Turtle–a camp for kids with serious medical conditions–and how the opportunity to attend helped her build her confidence and made her comfortable talking about her disease and how to explain it to others.
Though she’s always been active, Stella talks about how the role of fitness has evolved in her IBD journey. When Crohn’s prevents her from giving 100%, she incorporates meditative bodywork, breathing, and low-intensity activities like hiking, yoga, or just stretching into her days when her body is run down. She also shares her tips and the importance of communicating your disease needs with your supervisor or co-workers and how she focuses on making it through flare ups.
Stella’s advocacy for IBD began when she was just a child. While attending The Painted Turtle helped her practice explaining what IBD is to other people, she used opportunities like her elementary school science projects and high school projects to talk about Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. During high school, she was also recognized as the Honored Hero for her local Take Steps walk. Today, she continues talking about IBD using social media and online platforms to share both general information and her own personal story and what daily life is like with Crohn’s.

Intestinal Fortitude Supplements: https://www.crohnsfitnessfood.com/if (10% OFF use code CFF10)Cellercise Rebounder: https://www.crohnsfitnessfood.com/cellercise ($80 Bonus Coupon Holiday Special) I recently had the pleasure and honor of being interviewed on the Intermittent Fasting Stories Podcast with Gin Stephens, author of Delay, Don’t Deny: Living an Intermittent Fasting Lifestyle. Fasting has been one of the things that has truly been life changing in my never-ending quest to manage Crohn’s Disease. Practicing it gives my gut time to rest; allows my body to heal and repair itself; has given me a better relationship with food; and–in an unexpected twist–it has also taught me patience, appreciation for quality, and a desire to remove more clutter (emotional and physical) from my life. It’s a mindset and a lifestyle.
In this interview, I talk with Gin and share how my diet has evolved from childhood to where it’s at now. We talk about how I went from eating nearly all processed foods to focusing on a bodybuilding/figure competition diet and how everything changed when I had to start juggling what I could tolerate with Crohn’s. My dietary journey has taken me down keto, carnivore, and now intermittent fasting–where I’m finding joy eating food again and keeping both my health and weight in check.
I share how my fasting journey evolved from an unfocused approach that was difficult at first to the clean-fasting approach I take now that allows me to easily go 24-36 hours without eating. I enjoy more foods now than I ever have before and don’t have to worry about counting calories, macros, carbs, fat, protein, or anything at all. Fasting has actually released the control that food had on me. I no longer obsess about being on a diet or how something will affect my metabolism, and every day I’m incorporating more foods that were previously off limits because of Crohn’s.
I hope you enjoy this interview with me and Gin as we dive deep into my fasting journey and how it’s playing a critical role in my Crohn’s management today! -----Learn more about Gin Stephens and the Intermittent Fasting Stories podcast:
http://www.ginstephens.com/http://intermittentfastingstories.com/ In today’s episode, Sylvia Tam shares her journey with Ulcerative Colitis and how it led her to starting Beviva Foods, a gut-friendly snack company centered around IBD patients. She spoke about her decision, after a colonoscopy in 2011 confirmed Ulcerative Colitis, to focus on her mindset, dietary changes, and family traditions in Chinese medicine that has allowed her to avoid medications in the management of her IBD.
Over the years, Sylvia has relied upon herbs–such as ginger and turmeric–to help control symptoms during flare ups and has learned to balance life and manage stress through practices such as meditation and qigong. After being diagnosed, she focused on her diet and eliminated inflammatory foods and foods that were hard to digest–raw vegetables, legumes, tomatoes, seeds, dairy, and (eventually) gluten–and found relief with a simple trick of eating little and often.
As a wife and mom of three, she plans meals around the foods that she and her family can all enjoy and keeps things simple and fast with air fryers and all-in-one appliances. She also teaches her children the importance of good nutrition and how to cook–each one has their own specialty in the family!
In learning to juggle all the demands of life, children, and IBD, Sylvia lives by the four Bs of success: Body, Being, Balance, and Business. She sets realistic habits for her body, going to the gym, walking the dog, or just being active during the day. She uses meditation to focus on being and finds creative ways to communicate with her family–from text messages to notes in her children’s lunch boxes–during their busy schedules. The final B of Business is about discovering and declaring; learn something and tell someone. Which leads into her own personal fifth B, Beviva Foods!
In 2018, Sylvia launched her company Beviva Foods. She focused on what the consumer wanted, did market research, focused on ingredients that were good for the gut, and just re-launched her brand this summer with her PURPO all-in-one cereal, sweet potato chips, and granola. She’s created “food with PURPOse” that gives consumers a convenient snack on the go made from real food and quality ingredients focused around the purple sweet potato.
Sylvia lets her favorite quote by Vivian Greene guide her through the ups and downs and challenges she faces with IBD, “Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass...It's about learning to dance in the rain.” And to her, IBD doesn’t simply stand for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, it means Incredibly Brave and Determined.

Diagnosed in 2017, she described herself as stubborn and decided against taking the medications her doctor prescribed after a colonoscopy confirmed Crohn’s. Her doctor, at the time, was adamant that food did not play a role in managing IBD, yet her instincts kept telling her different.
Not willing to accept the idea that food didn’t matter, she sought the help of a functional medicine doctor. For the next year, she did well. She cut out inflammatory foods like sugar and gluten and kept to a strict diet. But despite her best efforts, in late 2018, she developed a microtear in her colon. The intense pain sent her to the hospital and she was informed she would need immediate surgery.
In a surprising twist however, on the day of her surgery–just minutes before–her surgeon came in and recommended that she not have the surgery. Instead, he told her that she could avoid the surgery if she took medications and followed exactly what he said; she took his advice and followed his plan. Kiersten went on a round of steroids and was then able to start Humira injections, with the help of her first doctor who was able to assist her with the paperwork for Humira’s patient assistance program since she and her husband were self employed and didn’t have traditional insurance.
Humira helped her symptoms to calm down for most of the past year, but toward the end of that first year, the effectiveness was already starting to lessen. Kiersten shares her recent decision to come off of medication–from insurance to family planning–and talks about her renewed effort in focusing on her diet and adhering to the Specific Carbohydrate Diet. While food has always been a passion for Kiersten, it also became a part of her identity. She talks openly how Crohn’s has challenged her emotionally and created difficulty in figuring out who she was...a former foodie.
She’s now embracing a new path, a new reality that has been shaped by Crohn’s. She’s sharing more of her journey, advocating for those with IBD, sharing research and information on her social media, and now revamping her blog to focus on what lies ahead with new SCD recipes and life with IBD.

La mia idea è quella di creare un “tavolo” di ragionamento dove si parla di tutto quello che gira intorno al CF.Sono aperto a consigli ed opinioni e, perché no, a spunti di riflessione! Ci sentiamo in cuffia! Hai presente quel wod con esercizi che odi? Hai presente quel wod che ti sembra troppo facile e lo vuoi appesantire? Oggi provo a darti una chiave di lettura per trovare il giusto stimolo in ogni singolo wod. Oggi ragazzi parliamo del giorno della memoria, in ambito CF i memorial esistono ma non di questa data. 
Ps: prima volta che registro in macchina (ho il Bluetooth, tranquilli) spero che l’audio sia forte e chiaro! Avete mai provato a mettervi nei panni del vostro coach? Oggi provo a darvi un po’ di infarinatura di quello che si prova stando “davanti” alla classe. Sono appena tornato da un weekend sulla neve e voglio condividere con voi l’impressione di una nuova attività (snowboard: è la prima volta con la tavola) con la base di preparazione del CF! Oggi parliamo un po’ del mondiale, i Games! Oggi voglio condividere con voi un mio pensiero riguardante i ritardatari che entrano nelle classi sempre più tardi. Insieme volevo anche dare una lettura diversa alla “punizione” che si da a chi arriva in ritardo!"

CrossFit Inside Out's Podcast,"The coaching staff at CFIO discuss health, wellness and CrossFit. Life is stressful. 

Stress can have severe impacts on our fitness goals. We sat down with Lauren Vilar to discuss the methods that she teaches her clients on how to manage and reduce their stress. 

Her website is http://wilmington-counseling.com/. 

Here are some resources that she provided to help you analyze and manage stress in your life: https://www.ted.com/playlists/315/talks_to_help_you_manage_stres On this episode, we sit down with Heather Fleuriet and discuss how CrossFit can positively impact those who struggle with substance abuse. 

Heather's parents own CrossFit Flora in Flora, Mississippi. We discuss being the daughter of a CrossFit gym owner, and her work as a substance abuse  Heather opens up about her former struggles with substance addiction as well as her current work as a substance abuse counselor and the daily conflicts she sees in the people she tries to help. 

Addiction changes people. When someone is addicted to something, they can't live without it. We discuss how shifting the object of addiction can change a life for the better. Addiction problems are spiritual, mental, and physical. By encouraging CrossFit workouts as a positive source of ""addiction"", those facing substance abuse can completely change their lives and the lives of those around them. On this week's podcast, we sit down with Dr. Jason Holmes and discuss CrossFit from a doctor's point of view. 

""Dr. J"" has been an Emergency Room doctor for 13 years, he has a fully functioning blog focused on living intentionally, very active in his church, goes on several medical mission trips annually, and (most importantly) is a husband and father of three. 

We talk about how your legacy matters, medical mission trips, life as a CrossFitting ER doctor, Dr. J’s current workout regimen, and goal-setting for 2018. 

We ask if CrossFit dangerous. What’s next for the American healthcare industry and how nutrition and fitness will and is taking the lead for those sick. 

Check out his website here: http://allenjholmes.com/ Oftentimes we think that Day 1 of a new habit is the most important, but really that isn't true. We sit down to discuss why it's easy to start something new, but hard to finish. The coaches discuss how they found CrossFit as a training program. We also talk about why we workout at CrossFit Inside Out and continue to do CrossFit as our daily training regimen. We sit down to discuss the difference between Wisdom and Knowledge, not just in the gym, but in every day life. How can you practically apply the knowledge that you learn in the gym to your life at home?"

Crunches &amp; Cosmos,"Join Mickie (from the One Strong Southern Girl brand) as she talks tips, strategies and tactics to help women get the most out of exercising at home. This is a BONUS EPISODE full of the latest updates to four programs that I talk about regularly around here, because they're great resources to use when you work out at home. I'm going to give you updates on Les Mills program, an update on Body Groove, an update on a new Cathe Friedrich program, and an update to the Sweatstyle program.
 So before we get started, for those who're listening for the first time, I just want to introduce myself. I'm Mickie, and I'm from One Strong Southern Girl, and today's episode is brought to you by One Strong Southern Girl. That's my brand, friends. And I help women figure out how to plan, execute, and manage a home workout routine that's irresistible and sustainable and will change your life.
 So if that interests you, then go check out onestrongsoutherngirl.com, and if you're ready to dive real deep and need a little more of a blueprint, then you'll want to check out my signature course, Home Exercise 101, and you can do that onestrongsoutherngirl.com/course. 
 I'm so glad that you're here today, let's jump right into all these updates.
 So the first update I'm going to tell you about is to the Les Mills On Demand workout library.
 So, if you have a membership to the on demand subscription service from Les Mills, it's called Les Mills On Demand, and if you don't, head over to season three episode number seven. I give you a full review of their program. It's amazing. I love my Les Mills On Demand membership.
 So, if you work out at home, this is a way to stream workouts into your home with instructors from around the world. You can learn everything you need to know about Les Mills on Demand in season 3 episode seven.. So, head back a few episodes and listen to that one after you're done with today's episode.
 But they just added to their library of workouts a hybrid workout that they're calling Enduro, and these are really long workouts. They're over an hour, they're like 70 minutes long, which is pretty cool.
 Every now and then we all kind of crave a really long, intense cardio workout. At least I do, and so I was pretty excited about this, but then when I went and looked at it, it's a combination of three of their other programs, and they splice them together to make one long workout.
 But the three programs that they chose are RPM, BodyPump, and CXWORX. BodyPump is an amazing barbell strength training routine with high reps and low weights. And CXWORX is a core training routine. So the problem comes in with RPM. That's the cardio segment that's included in these workouts, and it's a spin class. It's actually on a stationary bike. So if you're doing this at home and you don't have a bike, you're kind of out of luck.
 I can't do them because I don't have a bike, so I was kind of irritated when I saw that. Hopefully they'll come out with something else so that I can do them, because I would like to do a longer workout, and I would love, love, love to have a way to combine these routines together without having to stop and do it myself. Hopefully they'll splice some of their other workouts into another Enduro routine and use something else for the cardio segment.
 Right now I see in my library there are two of these Enduro workouts, and they both have RPM, BodyPump and CXWORX in those routines. One's 73 minutes and one's 75 minutes. So that's that. If you have a stationary bike and you have Les Mills On Demand, try these out. Let me know what you think. High calorie burn, long workouts. Awesome. So I love Les Mills On Demand.
 Let's move on to update number two. Number two about the Body Groove program.
 If you've heard about Body Groove before or if you haven't, they are home workout routines led by Misty Tripoli, and they are kind of a combination of yoga and creative dance.
 I would put them in the beginner to intermediate category, or just for someone who's looking for something really d I'm going to introduce you to five health and fitness apps you can download today and start using to help you in your fitness and healthy lifestyle journey. The best part is that they're all free. Today I want to talk about a very important part of your workout routine...why you're doing it. Because your why is really important to your success. The goal to your fitness routine, no matter where you are in your fitness journey, is consistency. Your Why fuels that consistency and fuels that outcome of whether you're going to be consistent for a week or consistent for life. The important facts about Les Mills on Demand. Find out exactly what you need to know about this exercise on demand service in this honest review of the program. Find out why I wish I'd tried it sooner! All the important facts about the monthly workout clothes subscription box called YogaClub. In this episode I'll give you my opinion about this service and tell you how it stacks up against the other monthly workout clothes membership boxes. Home exercise vs the gym--which one is better? Mickie tackles the age old question in this episode by comparing the pros and cons of each so you can decide."

Crushing Iron Triathlon Podcast,"Crushing Iron is an age grouper and his coach talking and learning about triathlon. Together they explore the mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual side of training and racing everything from a Sprint to an Ironman. Great for beginners and intermediates triathletes. Released every Monday and Thursday. Many of us get into triathlon to figure out who we really are and that process is more effective and enjoyable if we love the sport. Today, we reflect on Kobe Bryant’s life and his passion for, not only the game, but everything he did, and tie it into our daily approach with triathlon. Kobe’s death is a painful reminder that life is fragile and triathlon is much more than just the numbers. Find your sweet spots in training and appreciating the little things to make net gains. We get into the sport to grow and become more confident, but . . . what do we do in those weak moments? The best athletes (and people) are always learning. Today, we look at a lot of examples we experience in coaching and how we approach insecurities that pop up in training. The stress of missing workouts, injuries, worry about not being ready, judging ourselves too harshly, etc. Training should be a way to become more whole. Learn your limits and how to approach them in a positive way. We are by no means experts, but today we take an open look at the never ending debate over weight loss and proper race weight. Everything is on the table including body image, guilt, shame, binge eating, and strength vs. optimum weight. Triathlon is often a road to weight loss, but changing a lifestyle comes with a lot of stress and cutting calories is a slippery slope. We talk about finding your race weight and when to be at it. So many diets, so many choices, but what works best for you? We start with a little podcast reflection about what this community means to us, then head into managing training amongst the chaos of life. We talk about the things like the source of anxiety, how to race ""free,"" and why training means nothing if you don't have a handle on your life. Robbie talks about his biggest role as a coach, Mike hits on longevity and easing the fear after his father's death.  There's not much like the mind games you play with yourself at the end of a race. We call it ""internal bargaining."" Whether it a half or full Ironman or Marathon, it usually comes back to effort and execution. Today we look at how that breaks out within a marathon and the strategies you can use to talk yourself through the pain while keeping your pace. It's tough keeping indoor trainer rides and treadmill runs interesting, but today was look at simple methods that not only keep you engaged, but give you really solid workouts. Plus, Robbie checks in from his first day at the Dopey Challenge with a strategy plan for the rest of his weekend. Also, hot tea and energy, pitfalls of virtual training, execution based goals and long-term body balance. "
CSN3M,"Case Specific Nutrition Mentoring, Mindsets and Mythbusting. This podcast is for all things health and wellness. Topics focus mostly on nutrition and fitness, and work to help individuals and professionals navigate complex topics. ""Someone I know lost 30lbs in a month, so I want to do that"". 

What is with our obsession with rate of weight loss? We act as if the faster it comes off the more impressive it is. Or if we ""get it over with"" it will somehow be easier.

But isn't being a lighter version of yourself a result of living like a different version of yourself? So to be that person, you likely need to be there for good. Why then, would intense bursts of unsustainable habits be the desired route?

Homeless Crisis Happy Chinese New Year of the Rat!

Lunar New Year is January, 25, 2020 this year, so today I am doing a special Chinese New Year episode!

The Year of the Rat is the first zodiac sign in the Chinese zodiac cycle. According to the Chinese zodiac story, in the competition held by the Jade Emperor to decide the zodiac animals, the quick-witted rat asked the diligent ox to take him on a ride to cross the river and jumped down before the ox crossed the finish line, so the rat won the race and became the first of the zodiac animals. (from China Highlights.com)

Wah Lum celebrates new year with the local community by performing lion dance and kung fu shows.  We don’t leave out the firecrackers and loud music playing to ‘scare off the evil spirits’ either!

As per tradition, we will be celebrating for the next two weeks, and we encourage anyone in the Central Florida area to come out and see a show!  Full schedule can be found HERE.

Oscar joins me today and discusses some great habit building and accountability techniques for those ‘new year resolutions’!  Also – what do Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Splinter have to do with Lunar New Year?

Chinese New Year Wrap Up

  Today I thought I would take some time to discuss a few hot topics in the news: immigration, democracy, and the protests that have been happening in Hong Kong.  

As many of you know, I directed the film, Pui Chan: Kung Fu Pioneer in 2012.  The story was an homage to my father’s life and the Wah Lum legacy that he has created.  However, it is also a story of an immigrant who dared to live the American Dream.  

Like many Chinese immigrants, my father believed that with hard work and persistence, you could make a life for yourself in a new world.  His parents were imprisoned by the Communists after their land was taken from them.  My father knew that he wanted more out of life than the one that he then faced.

Many people today face issues that are causing them to want to emigrate: extreme poverty, oppressive governments, safety for their families, and the desire for democracy.

I certainly don’t have any answers as to how other countries should run their government or what is best for them.  However, I do believe in democracy.  I believe we should have our basic freedoms, and that everyone is entitled to those freedoms.

CHECK OUT THE FILM!

I discuss the inspiration behind the making of the film Pui Chan: Kung Fu Pioneer (which you can watch on AMAZON PRIME) and how it has impacted my life.

I promise it was not my intention.  Be lenient, please! My recurring guest Dan John has taken me on this incredible journey through T.H. White’s The Once and Future King, or The Sword in the Stone. In previous episodes with Dan, we discuss everything from fitness philosophy to musicals.

Many of you know Dan John as one of the premier fitness industry coaches and resources. His credibility as a strength coach, author, and mentor to many in fitness is world-renowned.

I am fortunate that he has agreed to explore the themes and philosophies of The Sword in the Stone with me and how they relate to modern times. Although this book was written in 1938, the lessons of education, empathy, gratitude, morality, and work ethic are relevant to today.

Today we discuss the themes of class systems and education, and how they impact society. Regardless if you have read the novel or not, the discussions that Dan and I have are interesting, lively, and enriching. I urge everyone to listen with an open mind and to let me know your thoughts.

CULTURE CHAT EPISODE: 122 James Hong on what he’s learned working on over 500 roles in tv and film

I feel fortunate that James Hong took time to interview with me today. He is an actor who has starred in over 500 film and tv roles during his 60+ year career. At age 90, he isn’t slowing down. It was great to have a little Mulan reunion with James, as we discussed our thoughts on the upcoming live-action film. James shared his stories on Hollywood through the years, and the challenges Asian Americans face in cinema. He is hopeful for the future after the success of Crazy Rich Asians, however, still feels we have a long way to go.

James is most notorious for his role in Big Trouble in Little China as David Lopan, and I could not conduct the interview without picking his brain about the film. He shared some fun behind the scene moments and even did some impressions. If you are a fan of James Hong, like I am, you will enjoy our conversation. I am so inspired that at 90 years old, James is busier than me! I learned so much from my discussion with James. We share the same philosophies on following your dreams and always fighting for what you believe in.

Curvy Girl in Fitness City,"Are you ready to start your personal fitness journey?! Each Thursday, join founder of ThiqFitness Stephanie Quiñones as she shares her fitness and nutrition journey. Join her as she welcomes guests as they also share their journeys and provide tips to help you on your wellness path. Introduction and welcome to the ThiqFitness 21 Day Challenge"
Cut Through Nutrition,"Have you ever wanted to know more about nutrition but felt overwhelmed by the amount of conflicting information on the internet? You're not alone.Join NHS surgeon Dr Joshua Wolrich and lawyer-turned-current nutrition PhD Alan Flanagan as they aim to cut through the state of nutritional discourse whilst encouraging collaboration between different healthcare professionals. Whether you're a layperson that wants to understand if celery juice can actually cure your eczema (spoiler; it can't) or a GP who wants to know what the current research is about low-carb diets for diabetes, this podcast is for you. It wouldn't have been right to conclude Season 1 without having dedicated an entire episode on the impact that socio-economics has on nutrition and health. It's a huge barrier to people both receiving and implementing any well-meaning advice that may be given, and one that needs to be acknowledged.

Relevant references for this episode can be found in the full show notes.

Thank you for joining us for our first season of the Cut Through Nutrition podcast! We hope this may be a solid base to come back to as we move forward. Talking about the pitfalls and the problems with nutritional discourse can often make it feel like nutritional science doesn't know anything. Fortunately, that's just simply not true.

In this episode, we discuss the current evidence around what actually constitutes a healthy diet, and what evidence-based simple advice might look like. Join us for the TL;DR of all nutritional science. No pressure Alan.

Relevant references can be found in the full show notes.

If you enjoyed this episode please do rate, review and subscribe! In this episode, we discuss how identity politics are making the conversation around nutrition harder, and why we must do everything in our power to champion agnosticism when it comes to our food choices.

We also discuss how to identify common nutritional fallacies, including the appeal to authority, appeal to nature, appeal to ignorance, exception fallacy and the single cause fallacy.

If you enjoyed this episode please do rate, review and subscribe! Join us this week as we unpack some of the important differences between biomedical and nutrition science, helping to further explain why the phrase 'Food is Medicine' might be misguided.

If you enjoyed this episode please do rate, review and subscribe! ""I mean it’s just food, right? Where's the harm?""

If we’re going to make a podcast with the intention of addressing the current state of nutritional discourse, there's nothing more appropriate to start with than the phrase, 'Food is Medicine’.

In this first episode of season 1, we discuss how the phrase came to be; why it's become so trendy; and whether it's helpful or harmful to furthering the public perception of nutritional science*.

Tune in again next week as we unpack some of the important differences between biomedical and nutrition science which will help further explain why this phrase is misguided.

(please note that at 27:39 'East Asian' should have been 'South Asian')

*We are both aware that the use of this phrase can be an important part of eating disorder recovery; the purpose of this discussion is not to diminish that. In this first trailer/episode, we introduce ourselves and explain a little about why we think the current state of nutritional discourse needs to change."

Der Baranski in der Rennrad-WG 



… lange geplant aber mehrfach verschoben. Erst war es der Wirbelbruch von CyclingClaude, der den geplanten Termin auf der Eurobike unmöglich machte, dann das abgelaufene ESTA-Visum von Marcus, welches, auf dem Weg nach Kona, den Zwischenaufenthalt in Frankfurt zunichte machte. Aber die “Sailfish Night of the Year” brachte ihn dann doch ins Rhein-Main-Gebiet … und somit in die Rennrad-WG.



Nicht nur interessante Geschichten gibt der amtierende UCI-Zeitfahr-Vize-Weltmeister der Masters auf Etappe 12 zum besten. Auch ein paar Tipps zu “Marginal Gains” – also wie man sein Rad schneller macht – sind zu hören.

Am 8.10.2019 beginnt um 18:45 Uhr die German Cycling Academy des Bund Deutscher Radfahrer. 



Zu Gast in der Rennrad-WG ist der Chef-Coach der Academy, Tim Böhme, der sich offiziell nicht Bundestrainer nennen darf. 



Tim ist quasi die Heidi Klum des BDR und sucht in einem Pilotprojekt für den BDR den “Germany’s Next Cycling Star” auf Zwift, zusammen mit seinem Trainerstab. 



Lange Beine können von Vorteil sein – müssen aber nicht. Statt am “Walk” wird Tim an anderen Dingen feilen. 



Was aber immer noch stimmt … der Weltmeister wird im Winter gemacht.



German Cycling Academy? Man darf gespannt sein!

Wir sehen uns in Motala!



Auf der 8. Etappe nehmen wir Dich mit zur Vätternrundan nach Schweden. Einmal um den See? 300 km? Mit 20.000 anderen Verrückten? Das gibt es nur bei der Vätternrundan, die 2020 schon zum 55. Mal stattfinden wird.



Rennrad-WG-Gast Thomas, Langsreckenspezialist Roman und Claude, der schon zehnmal die Vätternrundan gefahren ist, erzählen Dir, warum die Veranstaltung so geil ist. 



Neben ein paar Anekdoten, erfährst Du einiges zum Event, Anreise, Training, Strecke, Depots, Anmeldung und mehr.







Falls Du 2020 dabei sein willst, musst Du Dich noch bis zum 19. Oktober 2019 voranmelden.



Hast Du weitere Fragen zum Event, die wir in einem weiteren Podcast beantworten können, dann schreib’ sie einfach unten in die Kommentare. Vielen Dank.







Austausch auf Facebook



Zum Austausch untereinander haben wir eine deutschsprachige Vätternrundan-Gruppe in Facebook. Einfach beitreten und mit diskutieren!











Vätternrundan -- Strecke und Depots







Der Anstieg nach Medevi Brunn







Die kurze Rampe in Medevi-Brunn



Måns Zelmerlöw 



Und da war da noch ein Eurovisions-Sieger: Måns Zelmerlöw. 2015, ein Jahr vor seinem Grand-Prix-Sieg, trat er in Motala während der Vätternwoche auf. Ich kannte ihn nicht und ging deshalb nicht zum Konzert. Damals infizierte Måns sich wohl mit Vätternrundanfieber und meldete sich für die 2016er Runde an. Dass er wenige Wochen vor der Vätternrundan 2016 den Eurovision Song Contest gewinnen würde, hätte 2015 sicher niemand geglaubt. „Heroes“, hieß sein Siegertitel. So fuhren wir Vättern-Helden 2016 gemeinsam mit einem Grand-Prix-Sieger um den See. … und “Heroes” also Helden sind wir allemal. Ketten- und Vätternhelden!



Anmeldung



Im Podcast erklären wir, wie man zu einem Startplatz kommt. 



Falls Du 2020 dabei sein willst, musst Du Dich noch bis zum 19. Oktober 2019 voranmelden und Dir am 23.10.2019 als Einzelstarter einen Platz sichern.

D&amp;D Fitness Radio Podcast,"The D&D Fitness Radio podcast is the culmination of more than 50 years of elite coaching experience in sport, fitness and health by two individuals at the top of their professions:  Don Saladino and Derek M. Hansen.  Don and Derek speak with the world's top experts and performers to bring you the best information to enhance your health, wellness and human performance. In Episode 065 of the D&amp;D Fitness Radio Podcast, we meet with Michael Napoleon and Daisy Kenny of Super Speed Golf to talk about how their line of products and services have changed the way golfers approach training their swing.  By using a combination of slightly over-weighted and under-weighted golf clubs, Super Speed Golf can elicit higher club head speeds and ultimately, better swing mechanics, for golfers.  The variation in stimulus created by the Super Speed Golf clubs results in a faster and more efficient swing, with less overall effort.  This concept has also been applied to create higher speed swing velocities in baseball and tennis.
The SuperSpeed Golf Training System helps players increase swing speed through a concept called OverSpeedTraining. Coined by the SuperSpeed Team in 2014, OverSpeed Training resets the normal reaction speed of a learned motor pattern to something faster. This works by first reducing the weight of the golf club, therefore allowing the player to create a faster than normal golf swing. The brain “remembers” this faster speed as the training progresses through the three training clubs, which gradually increase in weight.

YouTube - http://youtube.com/derekmhansen In Episode 064 of the D&amp;D Fitness Radio Podcast, we introduce nutrition expert, Alana Kessler, to talk with us about the issues presented in the recent Netflix Documentary, “Game Changers.”  The documentary was produced by filmmaker James Cameron and discusses the benefits of a plant-based diet over more conventional meat-based diets.  The documentary takes the side of plant-based diets and introduces a variety of athletes that have been training and competing as vegans.  It also takes a closer look at the impacts of plant- versus meat-based diets on blood composition, sexual function and overall health, with some of these demonstrations creating compelling arguments for switching to plants.  We pose some of the issues presented in “Game Changers” to Alana to get her opinion on what is valid and what may be over-simplified.  As you can imagine, the answers are not so simple as ‘plant’ is better than ‘meat’.  Alana discusses how you enhance and clean up your diet without taking sides in the plant versus meat debate.

Alana Kessler, MS, RDN E-RYT is the founder of Be Well by Alana Kessler. She’s a graduate of NYU with a Bachelor’s and Master’s of Science in Clinical Nutrition. In 1999, as a freshman in college, she began practicing Yoga and meditation, after which, she continued on to train as an Ayurveda Specialist and Weight Management expert.

YouTube - http://youtube.com/derekmhansen For Episode 063 of the D&amp;D Fitness Radio podcast Don and Derek sit down and have a serious discussion about monitoring their own sleep as an indicator of recovery, training management and overall health and wellness.  Using technology that is readily available to consumers, Don and Derek assess their sleep and compare their results against the activities they undertake during a typical week. This, of course, leads to a discussion about the intensity of the work being done in a typical training session.  How does training intensity influence the need for more sleep and greater recovery?  Can an overly intense training session, particularly late in the day, negatively impact sleep quality over one or several nights?  What is high intensity training, truly?  These and other questions are discussed in depth by Don and Derek in an attempt to determine how individuals can monitor their sleep and make adjustments to their training, recovery practices and diet to optimize performance and general health.

We discuss Anthony’s new book, “Be Like the Best”, and the 12 years of research and effort that went into researching and writing the book.  The book includes interviews with 50 of the top fitness professionals – including our very own Don Saladino and Derek Hansen – documenting their expertise, personal traits, successes, failures and recommendations for young professionals making their way in the fitness industry.  Anthony’s efforts through the “Strength Coach Podcast” have allowed him to get into the heads of the top fitness, performance and physical therapy professionals and formulate a recipe for others in the industry.  It is a must read for anyone working in fitness, sport performance or rehabilitation.

Anthony Renna has been a personal trainer since 2004, first working with Equinox, then on his own at different facilities before opening his own gym, Five Iron Fitness, in 2008. He sold Five Iron in 2016 so he could focus on his true passion of providing educational resources for fitness professionals to excel in the profession. His mission is to help them find success and make an impact in the world by sharing all he has learned from the best of the best.  As the founder and host of both the Strength Coach Podcast and Strength Coach TV, he has interviewed hundreds of strength coaches, fitness professionals, physical therapists and gym owners. He applies what he learned by helping fitness professionals in his personal coaching and accountability group.  Anthony still trains clients a few hours a week and is a partner with Michael Boyle in StrengthCoach.com and BodyByBoyleOnline.com

Stop riding endless circles in the arena with your horse by subscribing to the Daily Strides Podcast for Equestrians today and begin Making Every Ride Great You’ve decided to refocus your attention on your riding.   But knowing what to do and where to focus your attention can seem a little daunting.  

If we were working together, either online or in-person, there are a few essentials that I would begin asking you to give your full attention to.  Now, obviously this would vary depending on your unique situation.  However, there is a foundation that you build in your riding which is centered on a few specific principles.  Today I want to share those wit Have you ever had a horse step on your heel while you were leading them?  Or maybe it was your toe while tacking up or grooming?  These are pretty memorable experiences due to the amount of pain they cause!

Boundaries are so important when it comes to making progress as a rider. In fact, I have seen a marked difference between the results riders get in the saddle boil down to whether or not they have, and then actively enforce their boundaries. Can we sit down and have a quick and honest conversation?
If you’re game, let’s go!

As I write this, we are on the brink of a new year and a new decade.  The timing seems ripe for making some serious changes in your riding and your approach to riding.

I would love you to be honest with yourself here…  I know that you know the answers to these questions.  Being honest will truly be the key to making progress with your riding moving forwards; regardless of when you are reading this. Have you ever considered all the different ways you communicate with your horse, every day?  All of the aids you have at your disposal to ask your horse to do things the way you want him to do things.  Imagine if you could become a little more mindful about what you are doing and how you are doing it…
When you are with your horse, there are so many different aids you can use, such as thoughts, body language, position, voice, seat, legs, hands, and artificial aids to name some... I am fascinated by how our minds work. Meeting and chatting with riders for the first time is one of my favorite things to do.  I pay close attention.  I love listening to the stories they tell me about themselves and their riding.
So many riders have themselves convinced they cannot do something, &amp;, therefore, take action from that place.  The place where it won’t work. 
This versus rider who believes they can do something.  They will usually prove themselves right.
Your Beliefs = Your Results Weight aids are often overlooked and underused by many riders. I want to help you begin to see how powerful your weight aids have the potential to be in your riding.  I also want to use your weight aids to see demonstrate how power intention and focus have on your goals as well.
Less is more where your weight aids are concerned. 
Your goals are similar..."

Das süße Leben,"2 Freundinnen,1 Vision: Dich dabei zu unterstützen den Ballast des Alltags abzuwerfen, um (endlich) wieder mehr Leichtigkeit zu spüren und in deine volle Präsenz zu kommen!Ehrlich, pragmatisch und komplett kalorienfrei! Du lernst wie du mit dem inneren Schweinehund tanzen kannst, wie du dich unterwegs am besten organisierst, und warum es sich lohnt, für eine Weile auf Zucker verzichtest. Wir sprechen über Fülle im Leben. Was das überhaupt heisst und ganz wichtig, wie du mehr Fülle in dein Leben bekommst. Denn Vorsätze im klassischen Sinne funktionieren nicht. Du erfährst warum nicht. Wie du anstelle sinnvolle Ziele für dich setzt und wie du diese auch erreichst. Viele Menschen rasen von Jahr zu Jahr und zwischendrin mal Bilanz zu ziehen. Wundern sich aber, dass das ein oder andere Thema jedes Jahr wie das Murmeltier grüßt. Die wenigsten ziehen eine nachhaltige Bilanz von einem Jahr, indem sie sich wirklich mit den 'Lessons learned' und ihren Stärken auseinander setzen. In diesem Podcast hast du die Möglichkeit einen Express-Rückblick zu machen! Denn wenn am Fest der Liebe Erwartungen und aufgestaute Themen zusammen kommen, knallt es gerne mal. Mit unserer Kommunikation können wir viel zur 'Entladung' beitragen. Wie das geht, verraten wir in dieser Folge. Ausserdem bist du eingeladen 2019 gebührend zu verabschieden. 
Hör gleich mal rein! Sie wollte bis zu ihrem 50. Geburtstag unter 100 Kilo wiegen. Ein Ziel das, wenn man gerne isst, in weiter Ferne zu liegen scheint. Doch Karin's Wunsch war größer als die inneren Widersacher! Tauche ein und begleite sie auf ihrer Reise. Denn das nächste Ziel liess nicht lange auf sich warten: einen Marathon zu laufen! Und nicht irgendeinen - den New York Marathon!"
DavidCornilPodcast,"In deze podcasts wil ik jullie meer inzichten geven vanuit mijn ervaring hoe wij de dag van vandaag mensen zouden moeten coachen (specifiek in de fitness wereld). We zijn een krak in falen puur omdat we niet beseffen dat we eerst onszelf moeten coachen! Waarom is het soms zo moeilijk om oppervlakkig een gesprek aan te gaan met mensen? Ben je dan zo anders? Zijn er nog mensen die verschillende eigenschappen van hoog sensitiviteit ervaren? Ben je het dan ook werkelijk? Hoe ga je er mee om? In deze Podcast vertellen Sarah en ik uit eigen ondervinding hoe wij het ervaren en wat het met ons doet.. ENJOY! In deze podcast doet Charel een klant voor en ben ik de Personal Trainer die de vragen van de klant beantwoord. Er moet een match tussen klant en coach zijn, dit is de basis van een mooi resultaat voor de klant! Charel is iemand die ik van vroeger ken en mij terug gecontacteerd heeft omdat hij interesse heeft in Personal Coaching. Ook daarover meer inzichten en tips in deze podcast. Enjoy!"

Many of my clients are fans of the show ""The Biggest Loser"", on NBC. If you haven't seen the show, it is based on a group of people competing for a cash prize of $250k. The game is based around weightloss and involves several challenges along the way. I wanted to give everyone a chance to have some of the Biggest Loser excitement by offering an August Fitness Challenge. 

My clients and followers on twitter were competing from August 1-September 5, to lose more pounds or inches than ever before! Today's show will announce the winners and talk about how they lost the EXCUSES and some extra weight! Do you think cutting calories starts with eating low-fat or fat free foods?

You're not alone. Most people think eating low-fat versions of their favorite foods will help cut calories and shed pounds. Well you better look a little closer at those food labels to prevent overeating and possible weight gain!

It doesn't have to be an either or--today we will discuss developing a solid strength &amp; cardio program--even when tight on time! One thing that could totally derail your weightloss or fitness goals is having poor nutrition. Many people say that they really don't know what to eat. 

Today's show will discuss the importance of good nutrition and how to incorporate clean eating into your lifestyle.

Today's show will discuss how self-limiting beliefs and attitude can keep YOU from reaching YOUR ultimate fitness goals. Obesity in the U.S. has reached epidemic proportions. The CDC defines obesity as a person having a body mass index (BMI) of over 30. Currently in America, 32.9% of adults and 31.9% of children are obese.

Today's show will focus on childhood obesity. If we don't focus on the children there will be a whole new wave of obese adults. Studies show that 30% of adults who are overweight and obese were also obese as a child.

https://www.mother.ly/child/benefit-fathers-kids In this episode, we’ll cover pro tips that will help you start your journey well.

1) Injury prevention

2) Food journaling

3) Reasons (good reasons) you’re not losing weight - AND MORE!

It is not only a powerful plot device in modern and ancient stories.

In Part 7 we’ll talk through CARBOHYDRATES and their role in your health and fitness journey. HINT* You don’t need to cut them out forever. 

The gyms are about to get very crowded all over the world…because of the new year! 

What’s sad is that most of the newcomers will stop coming by the end of February. 

Why is that?

The health and fitness world is filled with 4-week FADS ; 8-week programs; and the short term research to back up these spurts of well-meaning exercise and nutrition change. 

But around here, we know that nothing worth changing about you is short-term. 

In fact, that’s not how biology works, anyway. 

Anything short-term is a waste of time in the big scheme of things.

Let’s take a different view of exercise, nutrition and lifestyle change in 2020. 

Let’s create sustainable changes that will stick with you so that next year, 2021, you’re getting to grow further instead of spinning your wheels or backsliding!

It is not only a powerful plot device in modern and ancient stories.

It's a deeply representative part of the renewing process of psychology and biology on our life goals and experience. 

Losing weight, gaining muscle, improving physical health...what, really, is the point? And how can you stay motivated to continue doing what you know is good for you? 

Listen in as Coach Alex VanHouten sheds light on the matter!

In Part 6 next week, we’ll talk through the practical PRO TIPS you need to know in starting the journey so that you don’t give up where many others (especially during the new year) do - in the first 8 weeks!

In this episode, we’ll cover the potential you have locked up inside of you. 

I’m sure you’ve heard that your DNA is the blueprint for your body, but did you know that only certain portions of it are activated right now?

What would happen if you could turn off the undesireable genes and turn on the parts of you that you want to see manifest in your life?

Maybe you are more energetic, more muscular, less depressed, and stronger than you think you are. You just have to activate that potential in you! 

In Part 5 next week, we’ll talk through the HEROES JOURNEY and why taking on challenges is a necessary part of moving forward in your health and fitness journey if you don’t want to just “go through the motions”!

In this episode, we’ll cover the differences between short term and long term body composition change. Are you losing fat to “show well” in the next couple of weeks? 

Or are you trying to decrease body fat in a way that will keep it off for good?

An important thing to decide because you may be wanting both in 2020 — but the methods we use to achieve both are DIFFERENT.

In Part 4 we’ll dive into epigenetics and why unlocking your hidden genetic potential is worth aiming for in your pursuit of a better version of you in 2020!

Diese Folge zeigt auf warum das Gesundheitssystem in Wahrheit nicht die Gesundheit fördert, sondern Krankheiten bewältigt. Der Podcast verdeutlicht wie wichtig es ist gesundheitliche Vorsorge für sich selbst zu betreiben und das Prävention - im Sinne von präventives eigenverantwortliches Handeln - in Zukunft immer wichtiger für Mensch und Gesellschaft wird."

"Desayuno con diamantes: salud, deporte y mujer","Yanela Clavo trata aspectos relacionados con el deporte y la salud enfocados a la mujer La etapa más importante en su desarrollo Es importante conocer nuestro aparato digestivo Prevención y tratamiento Diferencias, causas, síntomas y tratamientos Menos dolor y más movilidad Cuidado y prevención de nuestros pies"
Desiree Lunardon Insieme per l'Insieme,"Ciao, mi chiamo Desiree Lunardon e amo circondarmi di persone che, come me, hanno deciso di mettersi in gioco. Persone che si pongono domande, che sviluppano idee, che orientano la loro vita verso la crescita. Vi racconterò le storie di coloro che hanno creato attività nuove, incentrate sul bene dell’ambiente o sul ben-essere delle persone. Questo podcast vuole essere uno stimolo per chi lo ascolta, perché ciò che facciamo solo per noi stessi muore con noi, ciò che facciamo per gli altri e per il mondo resta ed è immortale.Podcast di Desiree Lunardon, riflessologa plantare e del corpo Musica di Anna Farronato L’ospite di questo podcast é Lara Lago, giornalista in carriera che in questo episodio ci da qualche dritta su come raggiungere il successo. Un traguardo, sostiene Lara, che può essere ottenuto solo quando ci sentiamo pienamente noi stessi, quando tra mente e cuore scegliamo l’istinto. Non lottare col proprio corpo, bensì accogliersi e accettarsi. 
I suoi social, dov’è conosciuta come lara_lake, sono pieni di “foto che parlano” da scoprire, ma la domanda che ci vuole lasciare Lara oggi è: cosa succederebbe se non fossimo più insicure? Oggi ho parlato con Giorgia Baldisser che ci ha raccontato come è rinata da un periodo difficile, come si è rimessa in gioco a partire dalle sue passioni. Nell’introduzione del suo romanzo Ti racconto un segreto si racconta così: “Mi sento una donna in rinascita, oggi teamleader di un gruppo cicciotto di circa duemila beauty promoters. (…) Sono certa che la vita offra sempre nuove possibilità, basta saperle cogliere”.  Giorgia è una donna ottimista che guarda la vita con il sorriso. Vuole raccontare la sua storia per essere un’ispirazione per tutte quelle persone che si sentono in balia delle avversità, per stimolarle ad un nuovo inizio. 
 Questo libro è diviso in due parti: una prima parte che racconta la sua storia ed una seconda composta da molti “segretini” che hanno permesso a Giorgia di compiere la sua svolta. 

Potete trovare il romanzo autobiografico Ti racconto un segreto di Giorgia Baldisser nel suo sito www.giorgiabaldisser.it/web/ti-racconto-un-segreto 
oppure inviando una mail a tiraccontounsegreto@giorgiabaldisser.it L’ospite di questo podcast è Stefano Soldati: uno dei primi ad introdurre in Italia il concetto di permacultura e di Food Forest. In questa puntata parliamo dell’importanza di sviluppare un agricoltura sostenibile: benessere per l’uomo e per l’ambiente. 

VISITA IL MIO BLOG:
https://www.desireelunardon.com/ In questo podcast incontro Davide Cascino, professionista in omeopatia, naturopata e iridologo. Due chiacchere sull'incontro tra medicina tradizionale e naturale, che sempre più collaborano per il benessere della persona. Insieme abbiamo cercato di capire meglio queste discipline, a chi affidarsi e da cosa diffidare. Desiree Lunardon racconta come le sue scelte di vita l’hanno portata a diventare riflessologa plantare. Un percorso iniziato con lo studio teorico e l’apprendimento pratico, che si è concretizzato nel desiderio di informare gli altri su vari temi relativi a salute e benessere. Il risultato? Tre progetti che prevedono la collaborazione tra diversi professionisti e che sfruttano il potere delle nuove piattaforme social: “Eccellenza per il Ben-Essere”, “Insieme per l’Insieme” e “Dal Corpo all’Anima”. Desiree incontra Sara Francesca Lisot che ci parla della sua startup VIC: Very Important Choice. Un nuovo servizio esclusivo per la persona, per la sua salute e per l'ambiente. In questo episodio scopriremo come si è sviluppata e alcune delle sue storie più particolari."

Die Karlinder-Woche,"Gesundheit kann so viel Spaß machen! Davon ist Charlotte Karlinder, Medizin-Journalistin und Gesundheitsexpertin, überzeugt. Hier widmet sie sich immer montags einem Thema aus den Bereichen Health, Fitness, Wellness & Food und gibt Tipps, wie ihr gesund und fit durch das Jahr kommt. Warum sollte man zum Arzt gehen, obwohl man gar nicht krank ist? Früherkennungs- und Vorsorgeuntersuchungen können helfen, schwere Krankheiten rechtzeitig zu erkennen oder ihnen sogar vorzubeugen. Welche Untersuchungen wirklich wichtig sind, erklärt Gesundheitsexpertin Charlotte Karlinder. Gründe, mit dem Rauchen aufzuhören, gibt es viele. Nichtraucher*innen leben länger und gesünder und sparen dabei noch eine Menge Geld. Aber wie geht man es dann ganz konkret an? Das erklärt Gesundheitsexpertin Charlotte Karlinder, die vor 14 Jahren selbst mit dem Rauchen aufgehört hat. Wann habt ihr das letzte Mal einige Minuten oder sogar Stunden in völliger Stille verbracht? Wahrscheinlich ist das schon ziemlich lange her. Von überallher tönt und dröhnt es. Dabei ist Stille für uns und unsere Gesundheit extrem wichtig. Warum das so ist und wie wir uns im Alltag Stille-Inseln schaffen können, verrät Gesundheitsexpertin Charlotte Karlinder. Zu Fuß die Alpen überqueren? Stricken lernen? Einen Hund aus dem Tierheim retten? Dinge, die du unbedingt noch erleben oder erreichen willst, kannst du auf einer Bucket List festhalten. Wie man die schreibt und was auf ihrer eigenen Bucket List steht, verrät Gesundheitsexpertin Charlotte Karlinder. Es ist ein furchtbarer Zustand: Auf der Silvester-Party ein paar Gläser zu viel getrunken, und zu Hause im Bett dreht sich alles. An Schlaf ist nicht zu denken. Und erst der nächste Morgen! Der Schädel brummt, wir fühlen uns schlapp. Einige leiden an Herzrasen, Schwindel, Übelkeit und großem Durst. Klar, die einzige garantiert wirkungsvolle Methode gegen Kater ist, gar keinen oder nur wenig Alkohol zu trinken. Was wir tun können, wenn es dafür aber leider schon zu spät ist, erklärt Gesundheitsexpertin Charlotte Karlinder. Sei mal wieder dankbar! – Bis zum 24. Dezember öffnet Gesundheitsexpertin Charlotte Karlinder hier jeden Tag ein Advents-Karlinder-Fenster und ihr hört einen weihnachtlichen Gesundheits-Tipp."

Discover Health,"Dr. Trish Murray talks about working in partnership with each patient to create an evaluation and treatment plan that can help people transform their lives to prevent or reverse chronic disease. Focusing on functional medicine to help patients optimize their own health. Make sure to visit our website: Discoverhealthfmc.com Introduction:

Dr. Diana Driscoll is an internationally recognized researcher, inventor, speaker, author, and patient advocate. An optometrist by education, she was disabled for over a decade with “invisible illnesses”. Now fully recovered, she is the recipient of two patents to date and continues her research as President of Genetic Disease Investigators. She is the founder and Clinical Director of POTS Care -- the only clinic dedicated to treating the underlying medical causes of POTS -- not just the symptoms.  

Dr. Driscoll graduated summa cum laude from both The University of Houston College of Optometry and The University of Texas at Austin. She is a member of the International Society of Neurovascular Disease, the American Headache Society, the Medical Advisory Board for EDS Network C.A.R.E.S, the American Optometric Association, the Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society, and served as a medical advisor for the Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation.  

Her peer-reviewed medical abstracts include those involving vascular abnormalities in the fundus of POTS patients, the etiology of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and the use of acetazolamide in multiple sclerosis. She is the author of “The Driscoll Theory” -- the publication revealing the propensity for high intracranial pressure in POTS patients that dramatically altered how this condition was evaluated and treated. She has also authored “Your Eyes and EDS”, and was the chief author of the “Ophthalmology Medical Resource Guide” for Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation. 



Dr. Driscoll is the recipient of numerous awards for patient advocacy and continues to donate her time to help others across the globe through her online forum and videos on YouTube.



Her work in chronic inflammation, the autonomic nervous system, collagen disorders, and organ dysfunction can help others live their best life, as well as have their best body and mind.

Candace Burch is a Hormone Health Educator, and founder of Your Hormone Balance, a hormone testing + consulting practice that helps people of all ages detect and correct hormone imbalances that negatively impact health and longevity.



 



She received her Masters in Health Education (M.A.) in 1979, and subsequently worked in medical publishing in the UK, and as Director of Education for ZRT Hormone testing labs for over a decade. Candace is the co-founder of Women in Balance - an educational non-profit.  Her mission as a wellness advocate is to educate, inspire and guide women towards safe natural approaches to hormone balance and breast cancer prevention.







How did you come to do what you are doing?





My chosen career as a health educator, journalist, and women’s health advocate all started with a skiing injury that led to the overuse of anti-inflammatories that didn’t help and only made things worse. Herbal remedies and a cleansing diet eventually took away the pain and made me a believer in natural medicine, and I spent the next decade advancing the stay healthy, prevent disease mantra in media and medical publishing. It wasn’t until much later when I started having hot flashes every 20 minutes and meltdowns for no apparent reason that hormones entered the picture. In my search for relief, I found a simple saliva test that identified the hidden hormone imbalances behind my roller coaster symptoms. That information not only restored my health and sanity but probably saved my marriage!







At the same time, it propelled me into a Masters degree and my true calling as a hormone health educator. The rest is history. I pursued and landed the position of director of education at ZRT Laboratory and learned from the experts how to use hormone testing to detect and correct hormone imbalances, working closely with top experts in functional medicine and bioidentical hormone replacement therapy.







Today, I work with clients one on one, helping them detect and correct hidden hormonal imbalances, naturally, through my testing and consulting practice, yourhormonebalance.com.







What is the #1 tip or secret you recommend for healthy living?



Taking a brisk walk every day no matter what the weather!

Do Our Bums Sound Big On This?,"Join radio presenters Vicki Turner and Adam Gilchrist on their quest for a healthier life.  They’re challenging the chub with often hilarious consequences.  If you’re fed up with celebrities being paid hundreds of thousands of pounds to tell you how to fight the flab and you want a real-life slant on it from two people losing pounds rather than earning them, then this is the podcast for you Fresh from a fitness class and all aglow, Vicki is still on it, despite the reservations that some had about her will power.

Adam’s still on it too...the sofa that is...but he’s still determined that he will soon get going.

In this episode there’s an unexpected gift and a gift that keeps on giving! The journey to betterment is getting hairy. Do all men have fluff on their feet, do all women find stray hairs on their neck? We’re asking for a friend.

This week Adam gets chased by a Bobby and Vicki has a body odour quandary. But (and it’s still a fairly sizeable butt) things are beginning to happen and Adam has finally started his fitness journey...in earnest. They’re the Prince Harry and Meghan Markle of the fitness world. One was clearly born into it and is dutifully playing the role, the other has got a bit bored with all the interest and is busy finding ways out!

This week Vicki goes nuts for snacking, Adam’s at the cinema eating popcorn.

Will he ever just get on with it or is he planning an escape route to Canada? I know what my money’s on! Has Adam finally run out of excuses? His ‘Couch Potato’ diet plan is faltering and there’s a slow realisation that the only way to beat the bulge is by stomaching some exercise.

Vicki, on the other hand, has overdone things and is finding the most necessary of tasks a trial. Chocolate, mince pies, chocolate, trifle, chocolate, Christmas pudding, chocolate, cake, chocolate.

Both Vicki and Adam have overindulged but after the excess comes the exercise, well that’s the plan. Vicki is back at the gym. Adam has hopes of becoming as ripped as AJ, but so far the only thing that’s ripped are his shorts. Christmas is coming, we’re trying to not get fat, Vicki’s swimming at the gym and Adam...he’s just sat!

Although he’s not! Adam has been to Zumba...it’s a Christmas miracle. Hear how he got on in this low fat, high energy festive special."

En este podcast te voy a explicar porque es que sucede esto y cuál debería ser la solución a este problema."
Don't Forget to Breathe,"Welcome to the “Don’t Forget to Breathe Podcast” hosted by Sade and Anthony, a black couple living and thriving through fitness!  We talk about our relationship, our goals, and our quest for self improvement through the lens of fitness and health. What is the difference between fitness and wellness?

In this week’s podcast, we talk about the difference between fitness and wellness. We begin by going over the definitions of each: fitness is mainly dealing with just the physical body, while wellness describes all aspects of life, such as mental, financial and social health. We mention how having a “fit” body does not equate to a healthy body. There are plenty of people in the fitness industry that mainly focus on their calorie/macros goals and working out, not the quality of the food they are in taking, stretching or getting enough sleep. We also mention the fact that many people with desk jobs, do not take the time to move around during the day but go to the gym after their work day and think this makes up for being sedentary for eight hours or more. On the contrary, this actually does not equate to having healthy habits and this is something we both agreed we need to work on now. In the end, physical fitness is not enough, you also have to focus on mobility, good nutrition and sleep so later on in life, you are in outstanding health and you can look back and thank yourself for following these overall wellness habits. Thanks for listening!

Where to Listen Is it good to weigh yourself daily? Can scales be wrong?

In this week’s podcast, we talk about the misconceptions regarding using scales to measure weight and progress. Usually, people like using scales because they find it easier to measure their progress with simple numbers they can easily compare and they make them feel more in control. We touch on our personal experiences with scales as well and talk about the mistakes we’ve made when using them in the past. We leave listeners with a few tips to consider if they decide to use a scale to weigh themselves. Some of these tips are: only weigh yourself while in the right mindset, remember weight goes up and down daily due to hormones, water weight, etc. and consider using a body fat scanner or pictures to measure progress as well as a scale. Thanks for listening! Continue supporting our podcast and feel free to give us some topic ideas for the next episode.

Where to Listen How to avoid falling off track at the beginning of the year

Let’s face it, many beginners starting their fitness journey start off the New Year extremely motivated to reach their goals, only for that motivation to fizzle out and they quit. With this in mind, in this podcast, we talk about ways people can stay dedicated and avoid this from happening in the future. It is a fact that everyone on their journey will make mistakes along the way but as long as you are able to analyze those mistakes and make certain changes to avoid them from occurring again, you are succeeding! Remember, it’s mostly a mental game! Some of the tips we give are: don’t get distracted by other’s journeys on social media, following the two day rule regarding working out and getting someone else involved in the process for encouragement. Thanks or listening &amp; supporting!

Where to Listen Is making New Year’s resolutions beneficial?

In this week’s podcast, we reminisce and contemplate on whether we met last year’s resolutions and go over some reasons we may not have been successful in completing a few. We explain how important it is to start by planning and recognizing step one before automatically jumping to step ten, making your resolutions/goals more reachable. I have an issue, where fear holds me back from even starting step one and Anthony jumps ahead to step ten, finding it overwhelming and not completing the full task/goal at hand. We speak on our biggest weakness being “following through” when starting any habit and explain how important it is to start by changing your habits before even focusing on vague resolutions. We mentioned some changes we are going to make next year such as incorporating more cardio into our routines around the holidays in order to take preventative measures when overeating is imminent around the holidays. Also, since I’m a food addict and have been all my life, Anthony won’t give me a heads up when we have cheat meal days until we all get home so I am less likely to mess up my diet starting that morning. It’s important to find ways around your weaknesses so you can ultimately reach all of your goals for next year!  Thanks for listening and supporting! Leave us a comment and let us know how we are doing!

Where to Listen I’m Dreaming of a Meatless Christmas…

In this week’s (really last week’s but we forgot to post it oops!) podcast, we talk about our plans for Christmas and what we had on the menu. We planned on having a “meatless” Christmas so we mentioned some meat substitutes we’ve wanted to try. We also bring up the controversial Peloton commercial and give our opinions. After this, we touch on how someone can politely influence their significant other to workout and eat healthier. We also mention some non-offensive gift ideas for family and friends, who are just starting their fitness journeys. Thank you for continuously supporting us! Rate us and leave us a comment and let us know how we’re doing.

instagram.com/df2bpod How we are getting back on track with health and fitness after our holiday break

In this week’s podcast, we talk about our experiences over the Thanksgiving holiday and how we managed our food intake (new pescetarian diet) and staying on track while out of town.  We highlighted how preparation is key after mentioning some of our setbacks during the trip. We both gave our own advice on how someone can get back on track after a long trip and possibly falling off a bit during this time. I think it’s important to let your guilt go and start fresh when you get back in town and into your regular routine. I also mention that it may help jump start a health kick if you juice or detox in some sort of way (the most important key take away is to avoid packaged foods and preservatives and eat whole foods). Also, you can go on your favorite fitness influencer’s social media and get some quick, genuine inspiration from them. Around this time of year, fitness influencers are always posting tips and tricks on how to stay motivated during the holidays. Let’s face it, it’s difficult to stay on track for anyone! No one is perfect, remember that! Thanks for listening and please subscribe to our podcast for more weekly episodes!

Oftentimes we struggle to lose weight, to exercise, to eat the right foods etc. This podcast aims to help you programme your mind to help you lose the weight you want to lose and keep it off! RIP Kobe Bryant, Giana and all those who tragically lost their lives in the accident on Sunday. Be considerate of other people when you're exercising. They have just as much right to be there as you. In today's episode I share a story from my training session in the gym the other day on this subject... The human body is a wonderful thing. It's designed to move in a variety of ways.

Dosage One,"This is about our perceptions, our senses, about what we put in and out of our bodies. And ultimately, about us. Malaria is one of the world's most notorious health issues. And yet, some people try to cure it with a tea. The good news is: The tea actually works! The bad news: Not always. And each failed attempt is a training ground for malaria parasites to become resistant.

The Malaria treatment with Artemisia Annua might look tempting at first, but without proper equipment and training, this ""natural"" and cheap alternative can also play a role in the breeding of drug-resistant malaria. We take a look at the therapy and elaborate the basic concept of quality and quality assurance that is cut short with this treatment, especially in rural areas.

DOtheDamnWORK - The 'No More Excuses' Lifestyle,"A 'keep it real' podcast all about helping YOU master simplicity and control your chaos... with a 'no more excuses' mentality. As ambitious humans, we'll be the strongest version of ourselves, show up more powerfully in our relationships, do work that matters deeply to us, and take amazing adventures, together. How do you gain confidence?  What does it really take?

Then, once you gain the confidence, how do you keep it and make it compound?

There IS a formula.  

In this episode I break it down for you so you can take action on increasing your confidence, starting now! 3 simple commitments can change your life.  Yeah, everything is a bold claim until YOU do something with the information.
In this hyper-focused episode I'm going to give you 3 things that you can TAKE ACTION on, right now.
When you do, you WILL see an upswing in the overall quality of your life.
Without these 3 things, you will see a continued upswing in chaos and complexity.
Ain't nobody got time for that.
Enjoy the episode, and always remember...
...once you have the information, it's time to DOtheDamnWORK!

Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/dothedamnwork/message You’re an ambitious human like me.  That means, every now and then, the chaotic and complex side of life shows up.
When that happens, here are 3 powerful tips to create simplicity in your life, right away:
✅ POWERFUL TIP #1:  RECREATE YOUR SCHEDULE
It can be an eye-opener when you look at everything that’s ended up on your schedule.  Too many times we figure out that we’ve enthusiastically over-committed, once again.
A good question to ask when looking at each entry on your schedule is, “Why do I do this?”  Really answer that question for each thing.
When I do this for my own schedule (every quarter), I’m usually able to restructure, or completely eliminate, at least one thing on my schedule.
✅ POWERFUL TIP #2:  SIMPLIFY YOUR WORKOUTS
You are getting your workouts in, right?
What I’ve found, with my ambitious tendencies, is that it’s easy to get caught up thinking that more is better.
Trust me:  IT IS NOT!
For most people, 30-minute high-intensity workouts are enough to get into, and stay, in great shape.
Now, if you’re training for something specific, this may not apply to you.
If you’re looking to lose some fat, get healthier, and establish a consistency, then 30 minutes is the way to go.
✅ POWERFUL TIP #3:  FOCUS ON RIGHT NOW
This seems way too simple, right?  Once again, it’s not!
Getting caught thinking about the past or stressing about the future is a common trait for us ambitious people.
When that happens in my life, there’s a powerful one-two punch that I use to pull myself out of the hell storm.
1️⃣ First, I take the mandatory DtDW Power Pause.  That’s a minimum of 10 seconds of ‘eyes-closed-emotionless-breathing’ and zero decision-making.
2️⃣ Second, after 10 seconds (sometimes more), I ask the question, “Where can I create simplicity, RIGHT NOW?”
This question is powerful because it gives me permission not to figure out my entire life at this moment.  Instead, it’s a commitment to JUST TAKE VERY NEXT STEP toward what matters most.
Which of these 3 tips makes do you need to implement the most, right now? 
If this episode hit home for you please leave me a 5-star rating and review.  I'll never take your time for granted.  Thank you.  
Now, go DOtheDamnWORK!

Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/dothedamnwork/message In the last episode I talked about a dark time in my life, where I ultimately ended up sitting on the edge of my bed, with my gun by my side, considering taking my own life. This moment created a massive breakthrough in my life and fuels the reason WHY I’m building DOtheDamnWORK. In this after show, I bring you behind the scenes on my thoughts about that moment. I’ll also give you an idea of where this is all headed (website, community, app, etc).

Photo – Sven Martin We’re heading to the wind tunnel this week for something a little different.

Son conversaciones informales, con palabrotas y de vez en cuando un poco de humor. Igual hasta consiguen que alguien inteligente y sabio quiera aparecer en algún capítulo. Conocemos el lado mental y emocional de Eliud Kipchoge para intentar entender que su logro de correr 42km en menos de dos horas, no es solo gracias a su físico, si no que su mente es casi mas importante para cumplir ese reto. Explico nuestra mudanza a Ciudad de México, mis entrenos para la Maratón de Ciudad de México, porque considero importante tener un entrenador, mi experimento con la dieta OMAD y quién sabe que mas porque estoy escribiendo esto después de grabar... ah!

Isaac Asimov once predicted that in 2019 we'd be on the moon mining. While that prediction didn't exactly come true, that's not stopping some from attempting to get rick from moon rocks. Pretend you're an intern and decide to steal some rocks that are out of this world!


Special thanks to Katherine Garbera! Check out her Space Cowboys series: 


### No Limits
*Some cowboys are outta this world… *


Astronaut Jason ""Ace"" McCoy tried to escape Cole's Hill, Texas—and the memory of Molly Tanner's dark eyes and strawberry-scented hair—among the stars. Now he and Molly have jointly inherited her father's struggling ranch. And having failed his latest medical tests, Ace is on leave—maybe forever. 


He's determined to sort things out with the ranch and get back to Houston as soon as possible. What he isn't counting on is that Molly's only gotten more beautiful over the years. He can't promise anything as long as there's a chance to go on another mission. But even in orbit, this attraction has no rules…and no limits.


### Pushing the Limits
*""Houston, we have a hot-astronaut problem…"" *


Survival expert and control freak Jessie Odell has faced the most hazardous environments on earth. Training astronauts should be a cakewalk. Nope. Enter candidate Hemi ""Thor"" Barrett. 


Hemi isn't just some distraction. Jessie actually likes the guy—and that makes him more treacherous than an Everest ascent. It also means Hemi's that much harder to resist. With every hungry, heat-fueled encounter, Jessie skirts closer to that dangerous edge. Falling for this space cowboy is definitely high stakes…but could the payoff be worth the risk?


### Beyond the Limits
This mission is out of control… 


Astronaut Isabelle Wolsten fought like hell to be one of the final candidates for the CRONUS mission to space. She can't afford to be distracted by teammate Antonio ""Playboy"" Curzon. 


When the two astronauts are put in direct competition for a top spot on the mission, they'll be tested beyond their limits. Getting involved with Antonio is dangerous—but not nearly as dangerous as the feelings Izzy's starting to have for him. With everything she's fought for on the line, falling for this space cowboy might just ground Izzy's dreams for good…

He is originally from Youngstown, Ohio, where he attended Liberty High School. Dr. Banks completed his undergraduate work at Kent State University, and initially began on the path to being a neurosurgeon through Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine. Due to the low success and satisfaction rates of the medical profession, he decided that a Chiropractic career was right for him. He was one of the first D.C.'s in the state of Ohio to complete a recognized internship in Chiropractic. At Kent State, Dr. Banks was a member of the wrestling team, and while at Palmer, he played Men's Division I rugby. He is a former state powerlifting champion and currently a NPC competitive bodybuilder. He understands the needs of athletes, whether recreational or professional, because of his own personal experience. Dr. Banks has given on field support to several rugby teams, and off field support to hundreds of athletes including seven-time Mr. Olympia, Phil Heath, the Cleveland Gladiators arena football team, and the Rootstown wrestling programs. Several highlights of Dr. Banks' career have been outside of his office, providing care at local and national sporting events. He has treated several professional wrestlers from two major televised brands and a handful of mixed martial arts fighters. Dr. Banks was the team physician for the Cuyahoga Falls Cougars semi-pro basketball team during their run. He has traveled to Hungary to assist in providing free chiropractic care to not only people in desperate need of any form of health care, but also the Hungarian Olympic athletes that were training for various sports. In March of each year, Dr. Banks heads to Columbus for the Arnold Classic and the International Chiropractic Association's Symposium on Natural Fitness, which is headlined by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. At the fitness expo, he has been a staff doctor, helping to provide trauma care for the over 17,000 athletes. In fact, the event is larger than the Olympics.

He's a former collegiate swimmer, current endurance athlete and avid shed hunter.  He also hunts as hard an anyone we've come across, but Bridger is obsessed with performance.  He says, ""Performance is super important to all of us, whether it’s hunting or daily routine as a father, husband and professional. I enjoy trying to make the most of every opportunity. Limited time presents a unique challenge when hunting. Still have a lot to learn and I find enjoyment each season reflecting and trying to find ways to become a better hunter and outdoorsman. Most of these lessons come from failure... brutal but needed!""

Endurance for Everyone,"Endurance for Everyone is meant to provide an inclusive atmosphere for the adult onset athlete, where support and acceptance can go a long way in bringing everyone to a healthier lifestyle. It’s a way of thinking that doesn’t allow for obstacles to get in the way of the things you want to achieve. It’s a way of saying, yes I am fat, or obese, or overly tall, or old, or young, and I am slow or injured, or tired, but I can get off the couch and train, and I can compete in and complete any race I set my mind to complete. We thank you for your patience as we reimagined the show and thought through the direction over the past few months. Tonight Karen Clarke coaxed John out of his self-imposed exile to talk about his plans for the future and continued journey as both a coach and athlete in the endurance world. We even started off with a few discussions about New Zealand, America, some of the differences in how we perceive things when we return home and how the Noom program is helping John with weight loss. A discussion with Pete D'Amico of Fatman Chronicles and the new ""No Fear Project"" about the subconscious mind and how we tend to undermine our efforts by assigning roles to ourselves. The belief in who we are, what we are capable of, what we can and cannot do, can be a strong motivator and predictor in who and what we become. If you have parents who constantly hounded you about being worthless, no good, “bound for prison”, often results in an adult who actually turns out the exact way that was “predicted”. Been told you were somehow “less than” your whole life results in that belief within you, no matter how well you try to hide it. The inner voice, the voice of your father, mother, teachers, spiritual leader, is in your head and will remain there.
The conversation revolves around my use of the title “Fat Slow Triathlete” and Pete's ""Fatman Chronicles"" and how, subconsciously, we might regress in order to meet those role expectations.

#teamE4E #fatmanchronicles #flycourageous #enduranceforeveryone #nofearproject This is the short and sweet intro to the show that will only get better with time. I am using a new way to post and to manage, so we will see how that evolves. Hopefully the last 5 months have been great to everyone and you're glad to have me back.  Episode 176 is ready for your listening pleasure discussing the issues of body image and body dysmorphia (including an American Dad reference), John's thoughts on why podcasters and coaches, and even athletes, should pay attention to how they are perceived on social media, and wrapping it all up in a nice bow about why expressing an opinion does not equal judging.

Por eso no me sorprende cuando una persona me pregunta ¿Cuál es o cuales son los mejores ejercicios que puedo hacer?
Es un pregunta muy compleja y a la vez muy fácil de contestar.
Como respuesta corta si quieres saber cual es el mejor ejercicio, te diría que ahora mismo, en este momento pienso que ninguno.
La respuesta larga la vas a conocer a lo largo del episodio de hoy.
Si existen determinados movimientos que tienes que realizar esto lo puedes ver aquí:

Movimientos naturales parte 1
Movimientos naturales parte 2
Patrones básicos de movimiento

Te invito a que te quedes para que conozcas la importancia de los ejercicios básicos para un programa de entrenamiento completo.







Ejercicios básicos que debes aprender



Hace un tiempo un profesor cercano me dijo: “No existen ejercicios nuevos, ya todo está inventado».
Depende como tomes el mensaje te puedes amargar el día o continuar creyendo que puedes crear algo nuevo.
Los ejercicios pueden parecer ser nuevos al utilizar un elemento en particular. Lo que no cambiara es el movimiento que vas a realizar.
Por lo tanto los patrones de movimientos que hacíamos antes hace millones de años atrás, aún lo continuamos haciendo en mayor o menor medida dependiendo la persona.
Estos movimientos los haces en la sala de un gimnasio, cuando vas a entrenar al aire libre, cuando entrenas tu movilidad en casa, etc.
Sea el movimiento que hagas tus genes ya conocían ese movimiento, ahora solo falta estimularlo para no olvidarlo.
Si te pones a ver una rutina de entrenamiento “moderna” verás que continuamos realizando los mismos patrones de movimiento una y otra vez.
Solo que utilizamos un elemento diferente o una maquina diferente para realizar dichos movimientos.
3 Ejercicios iguales mismo patrón de movimiento (dominante de rodilla)











 «No ha habido cambios biológicos en los humanos en los últimos 40.000 años»  Stephen Jay Gould Paleontólogo, biólogo evolutivo.







6 Movimientos que puedes utilizar en tus ejercicios 



Dependiendo el entrenador cada uno utilizara determinados patrones de movimientos o quizas haga tu rutina de entrenamiento según músculos.
En mi caso en vez de suponer lo que otros hacen, prefiero hablarte desde mi experiencia y práctica diaria.
Suelo utilizar 6 patrones de movimientos. También depende mucho de la persona que estoy entrenando. Muchas veces modifica la rutina de entrenamiento según el trabajo o profesión de la persona. 
EJEMPLO
Si trabajas mucho tiempo sentado, con los brazos extendidos delante de tu cuerpo, utilizando una computadora, no es recomendable que en tu entrenamiento coloques tantos ejercicios de tracción por que podrías tensionar o contracturar aún más la zona cervical.
Si necesitas tener un entrenamiento completo enfócate en estos movimientos:
1# Dominante de rodilla
La mayoría de movimientos provienen de la rodilla, aunque si modificas un poco la posición del cuerpo puede prevaler la cadera.
Ejemplo: sentadillas
2# Dominante de cadera
Donde los movimientos están más relacionados con la cadera.
Ejemplo: Empuje de cadera
– Unilateral inferior
Este entrenamiento unilateral se puede agrupar en las dos categorías anteriores: ejercicios dominantes de rodilla y ejercicios dominantes de cadera.
Serían diferentes movimientos que puedes realizar a un pie utilizando o no apoyo.
Una estocada seria un ejercicio unilateral con apoyo. Porque el pie de la pierna que no esta trabajando esta apoyada en el suelo.
Una sentadilla unilateral seria un ejercicio unilateral sin apoyo. Ya que el pie que no está trabajando no se encuentra en contacto con el suelo u otro objeto (fuente).
 Esto te puede ayudar a darle más énfasis o cargas más altas a uno de los movimientos anteriores (dominante de cadera o d Muy buenos días, bienvenidas y bienvenidos. Espero que estes preparado para aprender como utilizar cualquier pelota para realizar tus automasajes en casa.
Una vez que aprendas y practiques con este elemento, te darás cuenta lo simple que es entrenar tu movilidad en casa y que con solo unos minutos al día puedes mejorar tu flexibilidad y lo más importante disminuir dolores.







Masajes con pelota de tenis



Empezare hablándote de la pelota de tenis ya que esta información es validad para cualquier tipo de pelota. Pero elegí muchos de nosotros tenemos una en casa.
Y si no es así no te preocupes ya escucharás las otras alternativas.
Pocos conocen el poder que hay detrás de una simple pelota de tenis. Y no es hasta que empiezas a practicar tus movilizaciones con esta u otra pelota similar donde de verdad empiezas a sentir los beneficios.
Como vimos en el episodio pasado, los beneficios se pueden percibir a corto plazo.
Una vez que realices tu automasaje con la pelota de tenis podrás sentir cambios.
Está herramienta, de precio bajo y muy practica la puedes tener a mano siempre que quieras en donde actualmente estes entrenando o trabajando diariamente.
Si actualmente tienes un dolor en un área especifica que con el rodillo no puedes llegar. Seguro la pelota podrá ayudarte.







Pelota para zonas específicas



Está pelota la utilizo cada día y la recomiendo mucho para zonas más difíciles de llegar.
Si eres principiante te vendrá genial porque no se necesita mucha experiencia a diferencia del rodillo de espuma para utilizarla.
Si eres avanzado te puede venir bien para hacer posiciones un poco más complejas que podrás ver al final del artículo/episodio en distintos vídeos.







Pelota para masajes vs rodillo de espuma



La pelota es otro elemento que puede formar parte de tus herramientas para mejorar tu movilidad.
Está herramienta es mucho más precisa que el rodillo. Además mucho más pequeña por lo que puedes llevarla a donde la necesites.
Si trabajas fuera de casa, pones la pelota en tu mochila o bolso y realizas ejercicios de liberación para tus antebrazos, codos, pectorales, hombros o plantas de los pies en el trabajo sin problema alguno.







Punto gatillo con pelota de tenis



¿Y exactamente qué es lo que buscamos con estas presiones y masajes?
Cuando te hable del rodillo de espuma no te nombre algo muy importante que lo estaba reservado para este episodio.
Se llama puntos gatillo o más conocido en ingles por triggers points.
Quizas nunca lo escuchaste o leíste pero seguro lo sentiste, hasta las personas más sanas llegan a tener este tipo sensaciones dolorosas en diferentes puntos del cuerpo.
Muchos de los términos que utilizo los resumo lo mejor posible así puedas entender su importancia y luego pasemos a lo práctico. Si deseas aprender más de cada concepto en este artículo tendrás vídeos o definiciones detalladas.
¿Qué son los puntos gatillos?
Estos puntos gatillos miofasciales son conocidos como puntos gatillo, sitios de activación o nudos musculares. Muchas veces sentimos estas pequeñas contracturas y decimos: “tengo un nudo en el cuello”.
Estos son puntos hiperirritables en la fascia circundante al músculo.
El termino de puntos gatillo fue acuñado en 1942 por Dr. Janet Travell (fuente).
Los nudos musculares son muchas veces inexplicables, se asocian con dolor y rigidez.
Como te dije todos tuvimos uno alguna vez, no dudamos su existencia. Pero la mayoría de profesionales aún sabe muy poco sobre ellos.
Tener demasiados puntos desencadenantes graves y crónicos es el síndrome de dolor miofascial.

 ¿Para qué es el masaje con pelota? 



El masaje y la presión sirve para favorecer un riego sanguíneo de la zona que deseemos tratar.

Tendrás consejos prácticos en el artículo que acompaña el episodio con diferentes vídeos para que puedas hacer cada ejercicio que te iré mencionando de la mejor manera.
Primero defino brevemente algunos de los términos que utilizare para vos en este episodio y luego iremos a lo más práctico.
Cualquier duda sobre este tema puedes comentar al final del artículo.







¿Qué es un rodillo de espuma?



El rodillo de espuma es una herramienta para tu entrenamiento muy fácil de usar. Puede servirte para aliviar el dolor, acelerar la recuperación del ejercicio y reducir lesiones (fuente).
Es un tubo de diferentes texturas y tamaños normalmente se ve un cilíndrico de espuma comprimida. 



Diferentes niveles de rodillos.







¿Qué es un automasaje?
Definición de automasaje: Método terapéutico casero. Su objetivo principal es tratarse a uno mismo.







Fascia y liberación miofascial con rodillo de espuma



Cuando toquemos temas de movilidad con diferentes elementos:
Pelotas de masajes, stick o palo para masajes, masajes con tus propias manos o ahora mismo el rodillo de espuma.
Vas a escuchar nombrar la palabra fascia.
¿Qué es una fascia?
La fascia es un componente del tejido conectivo y rodea todos los órganos y estructuras corporales, incluyendo los músculos (fuente). La miofascia envuelve y conecta directamente los músculos formando cadenas, que se conectan desde la cabeza a través de los todo el cuerpo hasta llegar a los pies.
¿Qué es tejido conectivo?
El tejido conectivo es uno de los más abundantes y de más amplia distribución en el cuerpo humano. Las diversas clases de tejido conectivo presentan distintas funciones: se unen entre sí, sostienen y fortalecen a otros tejidos corporales, protegen y aíslan a los órganos internos, constituyen compartimentos para estructuras como los músculos esqueléticos, funcionan como principal medio de transporte del organismo.
Fuente: Principios de anatomía y fisiología Libro de Gerard J. Tortora.
Resumen
La fascia es una estructura de tejido conectivo muy resistente que se extiende por todo el cuerpo como una red tridimensional (fuente).







Lineas Miofasciales











Restricción y posible dolor
Una función muscular alterada o la restricción de determinadas zonas puede surgir cuando sufres una cambio en tu mecánica normal.
Este cambio puede surgir por tensiones, debilidad, lesiones antiguas o actuales o por sobrecargas.
Según el estudio en el que me baso para hablarte hoy de este tema, menciona que cuando la fascia se ve afectada negativamente, da como resultado patrones de movimiento compensatorios.
Ejemplo sencillo y práctico que puedes hacer ahora mismo es:

De pie con los pies al ancho de hombros y mirada al frente.
Brazos al costado del cuerpo.
Ir levantando los brazos extendidos hasta que queden por encima de tu cabeza.
Cada dedo gordo debe quedar apuntando hacia atrás.

Una vez ahí analiza y siente tu postura:

Cabeza adelantada.
Dolor cervical.
Molestia en la zona de los hombros.
Curvatura exagerada en la zona lumbar.
Todo perfecto. Puedes mantener la postura con el cuerpo extendido sin compensar.

Esto es un simple ejemplo pero puedes evaluar de verdad cualquier parte de tu cuerpo, con diferentes test, si deseas saber que parte evaluar o tienen duda con algún movimiento que quieras mejorar, me lo puedes decir y te recomendaré que hacer.
Si tienes alguna restricción, está te puede causar dolor y quizás pueda llegar a lesionarte si te continuas moviendo compensando con otros músculos.
Posibles resultados de este simple test «Levantar los brazos por encima de la cabeza»











Efecto del rodillo de espuma en la fascia



Gracias al rodillo de espuma podemos llegar a diferentes zonas para reducir estas restriccione Hoy toca hablar de hábitos, vamos a empezar el año de la mejor manera con este listado de acciones, que te tengo preparado para vos.
Olvidate de los típicos propósitos de año nuevo. Empezar a hacer más ejercicio, aprender un nuevo idioma, comer más saludable, hacer dieta, dejar de fumar, perder peso, etc.
Como vez y escuchas estos propósitos son muy generales, con solo escucharlo y proponerlo ya no te dan ganas de empezarlos, porque son verdaderamente muy difíciles.
Siempre que queremos empezar algo, nos lo ponemos muy complicado. Empezamos pensando en grande (que por un lado esta bien, pero en este caso, no tanto).







¿Qué te propongo hacer con tus propósitos?



Te propongo plantearte acciones que modifiquen tu vida, una vez que empieces a hacerlas.
La idea con esta lista de acciones es que los vas a poner en marcha una vez y se van a automatizar cada día, sin que tengas que dedicarle tanta energía, creando un nuevo hábito saludable.
«Sin que tengas que dedicarte tanta energía» no malinterpretes lo que te digo, si o si… Tenemos que ponernos en modo hacer para lograr esto.
Vamos a dividir la lista en secciones para que este más ordenado en el artículo que va con este audio, así puedas leerlo o anotar algunos de tus futuros hábitos saludables.
Aclaro: No es obligatorio comprar ninguna de las cosas que mencionaré, en algunos consejos intentaré dejar la alternativa de bajo costo para que no tengas que invertir tanto desde el principio.







Entrenamiento



Empezamos con actividad física, ejercicio, movimiento, un gran hábito que te puede cambiar la vida, como ya lo hizo con miles de personas en todo el mundo.
Pero antes de pensar en hacer ejercicio, en planificar un entrenamiento, en contratar un entrenador personal, descarga una aplicación para entrenar solo con tu celular, pagar la membresía anual de un gimnasio al que vas a ir menos de 1 mes.
Tenemos que conocer algunas estrategias para que esto se cumpla y con estas ideas espero que logres entrenar más.







#1 Tu espacio para entrenar
No es necesario comprar un equipamiento completo ni muchos elementos caros. Simplemente ordenando una parte de tu casa, enfocada para entrenar, para trabajar tu movilidad, para poder ir directo al piso y realizar diferentes movilizaciones ya puede servirte.
Si tienes un pequeño espacio en casa disponible, coloca un esterilla una silla y listo ya tienes tu gimnasio en casa.
Claro, que si tienes elementos que pueden servir para tu gimnasio, son bienvenidos.
Lo que si mantén siempre en orden tu sector para entrenar y no importa si tu casa es pequeña. Actualmente donde vivo tiene 30 metros cuadrados y tengo reservado mi espacio para entrenar.
Que el espacio no sea una excuso y si un aporte positivo para que entiendas el valor que tiene el orden.







#2 Una pesa rusa bien cerca
Invertir en esta pesa puede ser un gran cambio para tu salud. Son muy duraderas, al ser de hierro fundido te puede durar toda la vida.
Pueden servirte para muchos ejercicios, así entrenarás todo tu cuerpo y en momentos muertos del día puedes hacer algunos movimientos para activar tu cuerpo y practicar un poco con tu nuevo elemento.
¿Dónde vas a dejar está Kettlebell?
Directo a tu espacio para entrenar. Tenerla siempre a la vista, limpia y bien a la mano ayudará a que le des el uso que necesita.







3# Escritorio o soporte para trabajar de pie
De estar trabajando diariamente en una misma postura, con la espalda encorvada, a poder alternar el trabajo de pie y sentado entre tus horas de trabajo.
Te ayudará a aumentar tu gasto calórico diario, tu movilidad articular, no vas a perder flexibilidad y podrás disminuir dolores de rodillas, espalda, muñecas entre otros.
También si en tu caso deseas mantener tu peso o perderlo trabajar de pie es un buen aliado para este objetivo.
Estos son no son los únicos beneficios de tr Estuve pensando si armar un sección de preguntas y respuestas en el podcast, ya que uno de los principales motores para que yo cree estos episodios son ustedes.
Estaría bueno publicar un día a la semana sus preguntas grabadas en audio o enviadas por texto, aunque me gusta más idea de que sea en audio porque siento es más cercano que un texto.
¿Dónde publicar mi pregunta para próximos episodios?
En mi web en la página de wwww.entrenadorwellness.com/podcast ahí encontraran un botón rojo que diga enviar pregunta.
Hacen clic ahí y pueden enviar su pregunta graba en audio, si no abajo para los que aún no se animen.
Dejo un formulario que dirá PREGUNTA.
Por ahora utilizaré las preguntas que tengo escritas de ustedes, que son bastantes y además las de mis alumnos presenciales.
Todo será contestado así que espero que está nueva propuesta te guste para ponerla en marcha.







Sus preguntas







 Pregunta #1 “El yoga es el mejor deporte/ejercicio para estar saludable” 



Primero aclaramos que el yoga es una disciplina física y mental que se originó en la India, según Wikipedia. Cada autor o profesional del yoga seguro lo definirá mucho mejor que está web.
Muchos y me incluyo en esta bolsa, veíamos el yoga como una practica para estar sentados, relajarse y meditar en posiciones incomodas que pocas personas pueden mantener.
Además como en mí circulo de conocidos, escuchaba nombrar al yoga solo en mujeres, automáticamente mi cerebro rechazada está disciplina porque pensaba que era dirigido para solo para ellas.
Esto es lo que parece si lo vez de manera superficial y si haces una búsqueda muy general del tema.
Para los nuevos del podcast siempre relacionado lo que aprendo con mi experiencia.
Gracias a mi novia que me quiso que la acompañe a una clase de yoga probé la clase y me gusto mucho. Nunca pensé que iba a ser tan complicado.
Mi recomendación para los que quieran practicar yoga es empezar de la manera más simple posible con las progresiones que tienes que hacer según tu estado inicial. Si lo haces de esta forma seguro te va a gustar mucho.
Volviendo a la pregunta “El yoga es el mejor deporte/ejercicio para estar saludable”.
Creo que yoga puede ser una excelente alternativa para incluir en un programa de entrenamiento y todo dependerá de tu agenda semanal como la tienes organizada.
Una semana de ejemplo quedaría así:

Lunes: Fuerza dominante de rodilla y cadera.
Martes: Yoga
Miércoles: Fuerza empujes
Jueves: Yoga
Viernes: Fuerza tracciones
Sábado: Caminatas, correr, HIIT, Tabata.
Domingo: Caminatas.

Entonces seria 2 o 3 días de entrenamiento de fuerza, levantando peso en lo posible y 1 o 2 días de yoga.
En mi caso personal, no hago una rutina completa de yoga ya que prefiero mis ejercicios de movilidad, que tienen mucho que ver con yoga pero es diferente.
Aunque últimamente los fines de semana estamos practicando una clase yoga aunque sea de 30 minutos con mi novia.







 Pregunta # 2 “Me duele la espalda y no puedo caminar como disminuir el dolor de espalda” 



Está pregunta relacionado con el dolor de espalda, concretamente hablando de la zona lumbar, me la preguntan de manera habitual. Ya que es un problema muy frecuente.
En un episodio hable de esto dejando algunas indicaciones pero hoy voy a sumar vídeos de ejercicios simples para que puedan hacer en casa, tanto para prevenir como para hacerlo cuando sientan dolor de espalda.
Tener en cuenta, antes de empezar cualquier tipo de ejercicio
Es importante tener mucho cuidado, si tienes dolor de espalda, no te pongas en posturas que demanden mucha movilidad, mucha fuerza, ya que tu cuerpo está resentido y cualquier exceso de movimiento o un movimiento no indicado para tu situación te puede causar más dolor.
Sé muy bien que el reposo no es la solución pero el exceso de ejercicio tampoco lo es.
Cada uno tiene que bu Quizas diciembre es el mes más esperado del año por muchas personas. En esta época pasamos más tiempo en familia y se suele utilizar de reflexión para analizar lo bueno y malo de este año y como enfrentar el nuevo año.
Todos o la mayoria por estas fechas vamos a tener más reuniones con amigos, despedidas de año, fiestas del trabajo, iremos al mercadito de navidad (si en tu país se suele hacer u otra actividad), entre otros eventos.
Diciembre y enero son meses donde la agenda está completa.
Con este episodio voy a proponerles un reto a mis alumnos del entrenamiento, personal, grupal, online y también a ustedes mis queridos amigos, oyentes del podcast.
Te voy a contar el reto al final del episodio, primero te daré estrategias y consejos para no consumir comida en exceso, mantener una alimentación consciente y movernos más o menos según cada caso.







Consejos para no subir de peso en navidad



Dividí los consejos en dos secciones, movimiento y entrenamiento como su nombre lo dice serán consejos enfocados más a la fuerza, movilidad, actividad fisica, etc.
Y el otro grupo o sección es alimentación, cuando comer, que comer, que debemos evitar, etc.







Movimiento y Entrenamiento



1. Muévete más. Si en las épocas de navidad, sabes que estarás de reunión en reunión, el primer consejo es que te muevas más de lo habitual.
¿Qué quiere decir esto?
No estes tanto tiempo sentado, intenta utilizar menos el auto, sal en bici, ve al mercado caminando, etc.
2. Camina más. Seguro para estas épocas tienen vacaciones, prueba con salir a caminar por tu ciudad, parque o zona natural más cercana en familia, con amigos, solo/a.
Otra idea puede ser, si te reúnes con amigos, propone juntarse pero antes y después de la reunión dar un paseo por la ciudad.
3. Haz más actividades recreativas. Menos reuniones para comer y tomar. Sé el raro o la rara del grupo para proponer salir a hacer bádminton, voley, fútbol, correr, cualquier actividad que sea en grupo y habitual en tu país.
4. Juntate con un grupo de personas que les guste realizar actividad física para ver qué proponen hacer en diciembre. Quizás tengan en mente alguna excursión o actividades que normalmente no harías.
5. Continúa entrenando. En el caso de que tu gimnasio, la profesora de yoga, pilates o el entrenador personal cierren por estas fechas. Puedes entrenar en casa con un entrenamiento de fuerza utilizando tu peso corporal o bien elementos como ser las bandas, pesas rusas o mancuernas tradicionales, tu gimnasio casero.
6. Adapta tu entrenamiento. En estas fechas puede ser que no tengas tanto tiempo como te gustaría para continuar con tu rutina de ejercicios. Una alternativa para no dejar de entrenar, es hacer un entrenamiento de menos duración.
Si antes entrenabas una 60 minutos, en estas épocas, disminuye el tiempo a 45 o 30 minutos pero aumenta la intensidad (más peso, más repeticiones, ejercicios más demandantes, etc).
7. Adapta tu entrenamiento al contexto y situación. Si sabes que un fin de semana estarás en la casa de tu mamá o de algún familiar y ahí no tendrás tus elementos y espacio para entrenar habitual.
Sé precavido y lleva una banda en el bolso o prepara una rutina de ejercicio que no requiera ningún elemento, como también puedes quedar con algún familiar para hacer ejercicios juntos.
8. Entrena a la misma hora. Mantén tu hábito de entrenar fuerte y firme entrenando en la misma hora y el mismo día. Si modificas los días de entrenamiento y las horas a tu cerebro no le va a gustar nada y seguro optará por no hacer nada y como tendrá todo a su disposición para relajarse, lo va a hacer.
9. Alejate de la silla. Será una temporada para charlar y conversar horas y horas. Hazlo de pie o varia tu postura en la silla. También puedes sentarte en el piso.Algo no tan bien visto en nuestra sociedad pero con much"

POSTED ON JULY 8, 2019 BY EVENTFIT

On this episode of the podcast I discuss a common emotion of mine, fear! It is responsible for most of what we don’t do in our lives.

Fear as an emotion  has helped us stay alive and evolve. However, in modern culture there are few things to genuinely be afraid of to save our lives, fear often prevents us from taking action toward achieving our goals.

In an equestrian context, fear does have some necessity and thus it is important to honour it and take steps to build courage and resilience.

Most of us are afraid of feeling unpleasant emotions and because we are fearful of them we avoid anything that brings them up.

What are you most fearful of?

What would be different if you were not afraid?

And remember – don’t let fear hold you back! In episode 9 I open up a bit about my life, my battles with feeling lost, the provocation for those feelings and how I found 'me' again.I am posting this for cathartic reasons but also in hope that it will help you too. You see, fitness coaching isn't just about getting you fit... it is as much about getting you to believe you are worthy of looking after, spending time on yourself.When you are lost, in busyness, in overwhelm, in anxiety you lose sense of self awareness, and if we are not careful can lead to a non functioning and depressed individual.

www.eventingfit.com In this episode I share with you my 3 main approaches to core training for equestrians 1. Rehabilitative movements, 2. Dynamic Core Training 3. Flexibility. Learn why sit ups and planks alone are NOT the answer and what you can do to make your training more effective."
Eric Hörst's Training For Climbing Podcast,"Training and performance podcasts by Eric Hörst, the internationally renowned author, researcher, climbing coach, and climber of 40 years. Monthly podcasts detail the latest training techniques to improve strength, power, endurance, as well as mental and technical skills. With his unique combination of veteran experience and knowledge of the cutting-edge research, Eric presents practical, effective guidelines to climb harder, reduce injury risk, and maximize the experience of moving over stone.Eric is one of the world’s most knowledge climbing coaches and his eight books (and many foreign translations) have sold more than 300,000 copies worldwide. His latest book release is the 3rd edition of Training For Climbing. Learn more at: http://www.trainingforclimbing.com It's the dawn of a new decade, and so I wanted to take this rare opportunity to record a unique and, hopefully, impactful podcast. The topic is...effective training for the climb that is your life.

This is a short and fast-paced episode, so I hope that you can find some quiet time to listen closely...and think critically about the 10 tips and concepts that I offer you. Search for answers to the question: ""how can I become more effective at pursuing my life goals...and enjoying every day along the way?"" Effective training can't be haphazard, nor done ad-lib. In this podcast, you'll learn a supremely effective conceptual model for training that adopts an ""intelligent system"" approach. Eric describes the nine elements of an intelligent system, and how you can incorporate this system to optimize training results and accelerate goal pursuit! If you're serious about training and climbing your best, then you must be serious about performance nutrition. The foods you consume play a central role in energy production, training adaptations, muscle recovery, connective tissue health, and your strength-to-weight ratio. Combined, these nutritional influences are nearly as significant as the influence of your training program--and, if you get both your training and nutrition right, then a powerful synergy will elevate your performance to a new level! The focus of this podcast is Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) training. This training modality has been around for decades but has only been recently popularized by some physiotherapists and coaches. Among climbers, perhaps no one is more knowledgable on this topic than Dr. Tyler Nelson, so I invited Tyler to join me for this podcast. In this 40-minute interview, we'll explore the different BFR training protocols, and how BFR training may be a beneficial intervention for injured and healthy climbers alike. This is fourth in a series on sinew training with a specific focus on climbing injuries and prevention. Incidence of climbing injuries is growing, and overuse injuries to the fingers, elbows, &amp; shoulders are common among beginners and expert alike.

Eric lays out the perfect storm of factors that make upper extremity overuse injuries so common. You will learn countermeasures to reduce your injury risk and increase tendon health and finger flexor pulley strength. This podcast may be a game-changer for you! In this episode of Ask Coach Hörst...Eric answers 7 wide-ranging questions submitted to him in recent weeks. Some of the topics covered are...energy system training for alactic power, climbing-specific aerobic energy system training, Tabata training on a hangboard, advice for a beginner wanting to hangboard train, the pros/cons of Ketogenic diet, accelerating healing of an A2 pulley injury.

Eric Hörst's Training For Climbing Podcast,"Training and performance podcasts by Eric Hörst, the internationally renowned author, researcher, climbing coach, and climber of 40 years. Monthly podcasts detail the latest training techniques to improve strength, power, endurance, as well as mental and technical skills. With his unique combination of veteran experience and knowledge of the cutting-edge research, Eric presents practical, effective guidelines to climb harder, reduce injury risk, and maximize the experience of moving over stone.Eric is one of the world’s most knowledge climbing coaches and his eight books (and many foreign translations) have sold more than 300,000 copies worldwide. His latest book release is the 3rd edition of Training For Climbing. Learn more at: http://www.trainingforclimbing.com It's the dawn of a new decade, and so I wanted to take this rare opportunity to record a unique and, hopefully, impactful podcast. The topic is...effective training for the climb that is your life.

This is a short and fast-paced episode, so I hope that you can find some quiet time to listen closely...and think critically about the 10 tips and concepts that I offer you. Search for answers to the question: ""how can I become more effective at pursuing my life goals...and enjoying every day along the way?"" Effective training can't be haphazard, nor done ad-lib. In this podcast, you'll learn a supremely effective conceptual model for training that adopts an ""intelligent system"" approach. Eric describes the nine elements of an intelligent system, and how you can incorporate this system to optimize training results and accelerate goal pursuit! If you're serious about training and climbing your best, then you must be serious about performance nutrition. The foods you consume play a central role in energy production, training adaptations, muscle recovery, connective tissue health, and your strength-to-weight ratio. Combined, these nutritional influences are nearly as significant as the influence of your training program--and, if you get both your training and nutrition right, then a powerful synergy will elevate your performance to a new level! The focus of this podcast is Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) training. This training modality has been around for decades but has only been recently popularized by some physiotherapists and coaches. Among climbers, perhaps no one is more knowledgable on this topic than Dr. Tyler Nelson, so I invited Tyler to join me for this podcast. In this 40-minute interview, we'll explore the different BFR training protocols, and how BFR training may be a beneficial intervention for injured and healthy climbers alike. This is fourth in a series on sinew training with a specific focus on climbing injuries and prevention. Incidence of climbing injuries is growing, and overuse injuries to the fingers, elbows, &amp; shoulders are common among beginners and expert alike.

Eric lays out the perfect storm of factors that make upper extremity overuse injuries so common. You will learn countermeasures to reduce your injury risk and increase tendon health and finger flexor pulley strength. This podcast may be a game-changer for you! In this episode of Ask Coach Hörst...Eric answers 7 wide-ranging questions submitted to him in recent weeks. Some of the topics covered are...energy system training for alactic power, climbing-specific aerobic energy system training, Tabata training on a hangboard, advice for a beginner wanting to hangboard train, the pros/cons of Ketogenic diet, accelerating healing of an A2 pulley injury. Listen in!"

Escuela Culturismo Natural,"Tanto en el entrenamiento como en la alimentación se oye todo y lo contrario de todo.Difícil es entender dónde termina la información y empieza el marketing. En los gimnasios no existen parámetros numéricos y la ausencia de objetividad no permite valorar hacia donde “navegamos” y cuando somos víctimas de “las sirenas”. Nosotros partimos de los estudios científicos y la teoría académica para llegar a la práctica en el campo del entrenamiento SIN fármacos dopantes, intentando explicar de manera sencilla argumentos complejos. Prácticamente GRATIS, al alcance de TODOS y nadie habla de ello, pero me atrevo a asegurar que es el MEJOR SUPLEMENTO para DEPORTISTAS. ¿Puedes ENTRENAR tu CAPACIDAD de llegar al FALLO? ¿Es lo mismo FALLO TÉCNICO que FALLO MUSCULAR? Descúbrelo. Garra, sangre, estilo de vida... Hablamos POCO o NADA de estos factores que sin duda son DETERMINANTES en nuestros deportes. ¿Fallar o no fallar? Esa es la cuestión. Para ganar MÚSCULO, yo lo tengo claro 😯"

   What happens when you are in a relationship and your ritual of going to the gym doesn't make sense to the other person? How can we effectively communicate to our significant other what is important to us and why? Compromise in relationships are a must, but should you have to sacrifice your own health and fitness just because it is not as important to the other person? All these questions and more we explore in the January 2020 relationship health episode.

We all can agree that, when it comes to improving our health and fitness we have to put in the reps. Usually that means in the gym. But... what about our spiritual health? How can we go deeper on the parts of our progress in the gym and in life that we can't quite put a finger on as to why things are working so well (or not)? Sal Di Stefano and Adam Schafer of Mind Pump and Josiah Novak of True Transformation and I begin discussing what we believe it means to be authentic and our interpretation of masculinity but quickly find ourselves talking about religion, spirituality and even the ""woo"".

His next challenge is an event is the Newy 100 which he personally organised.  We chat about his personal battles, past fundraising ventures, the challenges of a race director and why he chose to raise awareness for Lifeline.  In this episode we talk with Bill who has been diagnosed with bipolar type 2.

Be open and ask yourself ""What is the ONE THING that will speak to my heart?"" during today's episode. Here is the question - If this was your last year alive, how would you live it? True life change comes about when we don't go it alone, and regardless of where we are in life I believe that we have the ability to learn from an unlimited wealth of knowledge, wisdom, and communication by tapping into our resources.

Rather than repeating unrealistic goals from years prior, I want to personally walk you through five key methods for goal-setting that will help with developing traction, gaining momentum, and realizing when the path before you is truly your calling or when it is okay to move onto something else.

Whether you're an avid ultra-endurance cyclist or you've just heard of the term bikepacking, we hope to provide you with entertainment, inspiration, and tips for your next experience by bike. Chase Medina is an experienced backpacker, who immediately jumped in to the sport of bikepacking and ultra-endurance cycling after watching the movie ""Ride the Divide"" by Mike Dion.

Chase then followed this up with his first ultra-endurance bikepacking race being the 2,700 mile Tour Divide (which he raced with his own DIY rigid saddle bag using Cuben Fiber and Carbon Fiber poles). In this episode Chase and I discuss his background as a backpacker/bikepacker, and then we dive in to gear talk - one of the more popular topics in our sport! Chase tests his gear to the extreme, and then uses this knowledge to create his own gear (such as the cuben fiber saddle bag). We discuss resources for new bikepackers, and tips for those interested in creating their own gear, I hope you enjoy!

Early on Josh was always active. Playing baseball and college then finding that competitive fire 🔥 in CrossFit in his early 20s after he left college.
-
It was amazing talking to him not only about his competitive life but his life following Christ. Being able to use CrossFit as a platform to share what God has done for him.
-
In life we all go through struggles, through dark times. Times we wish we could take back and do over.
-
Gods grace is so good to us and Josh so elegantly discusses that in his life and growing up.
-
We also discussed how when Josh started putting God first in his life, He made a move in Josh’s life.
-
I’ve always had my better days when I put God first before anything else. Sometimes it requires you getting up early. Before life hits ya, make some coffee, grab your devotional or bible and just talk to him.
-
It was an absolute pleasure speaking with Josh. While running his family, training for the CrossFit Open and managing life, I was very grateful for his time.

Faszination Rennrad - der ROADBIKE-Podcast,"Faszination Rennrad, das ist immer auch die Faszination der Geschwindigkeit, die wir aus eigener Kraft erreichen können. Ein Gefühl fast wie fliegen. Über diese Faszination sprechen wir im ROADBIKE-Podcast und über alles, was dazu gehört: über Trends bei Technik und Equipment, über Training und Wettkampf, über Traum-Pässe und -Strecken und nicht zuletzt über und mit den Protagonisten der Rennradszene. Die ROADBIKE-Redakteure Sebastian, Christian und Moritz blicken zurück auf ihre ersten Geh- und Stehversuche mit dem Rennrad und geben TIpps, welche Fehler man als Anfänger (und auch als alter Hase!) vermeiden sollte. Ende 2019 war der Rad-Versender Canyon Ziel eines Hackerangriffs. Wurden Kundendaten gestohlen? Was passiert mit den Bestellungen? Im Interview beantwortet Canyons Global Communications Manager Thorsten Lewandowski die wichtigsten Fragen. Franziska Koch, 19, ist Radprofi in der Frauenmannschaft des Teams Sunweb. Mit ROADBIKE sprach sie über ihre ersten Monate im Profipeloton, den Frauenradsport und ihre Ziele. Vor 10 Jahren kam die erste Di2-Schaltung von Shimano auf den Markt und läutete das Zeitalter der (marktreifen) elektronischen Schaltungen ein. Hat die mechanische Schaltung mittlerweile endgültig ausgedient? Der Jahreswechsel steht vor der Tür. Zeit, die Highlights des letzen Jahres Revue passieren zu lassen und sich auf alles zu freuen, was 2020 bringen wird! Wir sprechen über unsere Höhepunkte im Profisport, fachsimpeln über Technik-Highlights und berichten von ganz persönlichen Rennrad-Erlebnissen. Volle Bahnen, Stau auf der Straße, CO2-Scham? Wir Rennradfahrer wissen, was dagegen hilft: mit dem Rad zur Arbeit fahren! ROADBIKE-Redakteur Christian Brunker fährt oft viele Kilometer mit dem Rad in die Redaktion. Er diskutiert in dieser Folge Freud und Leid des Rad-Pendlers mit Kollegen unserer anderen Radmagazine und gibt dabei auch jede Menge Tipps, wie Rad-Pendeln richtig Spaß macht."

Learn to exercise efficiently and feed your body the nutrition it needs to sculpt the look you want. To get started, download your free meal plan and start eating real food! This is a podcast that will educate and inspire you to write your own Fat Loss Success Story! I'm your host, Veronica Hugger, who at the age of 53 was ready to give up. I was living an unsustainable lifestyle of deprivation diets and endless exercise and not seeing the results I wanted or deserved. By learning the FASTer Way of nutrition and fitness, I now live a 'healthstyle' which encourages me to eat right and motivates me to exercise efficiently. My FASTer Way coach continues to work with me so I have access to a personal trainer who manages my progress, answers my questions, and inspires me.I was persuaded to try the FASTer Way after listening to stories from others who continue to succeed on the program. Over 130,000 people have gone through the FASTer Way starter program, so there are lots of success stories! On this podcast, you’ll hear conversational interviews with people with various relatable stories of struggle and success. And FASTer Way to Fat Loss certified coach, Le Bergin, helps explain the strategies of the program and offer helpful tips.Just like someone else’s success story inspired me, sharing more success stories has the potential to encourage others to embrace and experience a healthier lifestyle…a “healthstyle”. And their shared stories will educate you, inspire you, and encourage you to accomplish your goals and to write your own Fat Loss Success Story!If you're on the FASTer Way and ready to share your story, contact me to be on the show! Jen was so pleased with her progress on the FASTer Way that she threw out her bathroom scale! Don’t let numbers on a scale be your measurement of success. It’s about how you feel and fit: are you mobile and physically strong? Are your clothes getting too big? How’s your sleep? Energy level? It’s those non-scale victories that measure success! ""If it matters to you, you’ll find a way; if it doesn’t, you’ll find an excuse."" Because of the ease and success of the FASTer Way, there are no more excuses. It’s up to you to decide to make the changes you need to make, to get where you want to be. Losing weight and getting fit takes work. That’s why having a supportive community and a positive mindset can make a big difference. These two important factors are the true power behind the FASTer Way to Fat Loss and are key to your success. Rest and hormones go hand in hand, because stress may put strain on your adrenal and thyroid glands and prevent your body from burning fat. The FASTer Way workouts are designed strategically to pair with what you are eating in your food cycle...to maximize results and optimize your metabolism. Carb cycling, when combined with other scientifically proven methods such as intermittent fasting and strategic workouts, provides a realistic healthy lifestyle that leads to sustainable fat loss, muscle strength, and overall well-being."

 www.shelbyrowproductions.com In this week's episode, I had the pleasure of interviewing my Friends With Benefits group coaching client, Dr Roma Amin.
 Dr Amin is a family physician who was kind enough to open up and share her dieting struggles as she navigated medical residency while simultaneously planning a wedding. During this stressful time in her life, Roma, often turned to food as a way to delay studying or ""reward"" herself for surviving another hard day.
 Despite being a medical professional who understands the intricate ins and outs of the human body, Dr Roma struggled with the psychological aspect of dieting. After years of losing and regaining the same 15-20 pounds, she finally reached her breaking point and joined my Friends With Benefits program to put her dieting struggles behind her once and for all.
 In this episode, Dr Amin and I discuss:
   The biggest challenges Roma faced as an emotional eater and how she was able to overcome these obstacles through accountability and group support.  How measuring progress through habit tracking and non-scale victories (instead of scale weight) has contributed to successful weight loss she can maintain for the rest of her life.  Interestingly, Roma shares what percentage of her patients are overweight and how this has had a profound effect on other aspects of their health.  What holiday and social eating looks like for her now compared to years previous (hint: no more food anxiety or fear of being out of control)  Dr Amin's shares her 3 BEST pieces of advice for those who fear they'll gain weight if they stop calorie counting and focus on weight loss through behavior change.  ...and so much more! You definitely DONT want to miss this insightful episode. Give it a listen and let us know what you think in the comments!

 www.shelbyrowproductions.com In this episode, I had the pleasure of interviewing my current client, Andrea Seabrands, who was a Weight Watchers member for 15 years -- eventually becoming one of their leaders.
 As a former leader, Andrea was able to share an exclusive look into Weight Watchers behind the scenes and elaborates on why she ditched the point counting in exchange for a more mindful approach.
 Topics discussed:
 How diets like WW keep you struggling and why using a habit-based approach has allowed Andrea to feel in control around food.
 What it's like to transition away from a food-obsessed chronic dieter to someone who effortlessly maintains their weight.
 At what point in the process the habits began to *click* and become more automated.
 Why she referred a friend to work with me but was reluctant to get started on making the change for herself.
 The three things Andrea wished she knew at the beginning of the program and her best piece of advice for anyone who fears gaining weight when dropping the restrictive food rules, calorie counting, and mind-numbing cardio.

He has been practising handstands and hand balancing for 10 years. It took him over 1 year alone with daily practice to be able to do a handstand. On this episode, Miguel reflects on occasions his friends would be out drinking and Miguel would be at home, practising his craft.

His hard work paid off and he is one of the world's leading hand balancers.

Miguel leaves us with a great message - not to have expectations of ourselves; rather enjoy the process and show up daily. In 2018 he was ranked 4th in Australia. He competes in CrossFit games solo and with a team. Royce's max PB's are:
Deadlift 260kg
Back squat 225kg
Overhead press 102.5kg

Royce explains how the best CrossFitters are well-rounded individuals who have excellent consistency with their training.

Royce is a proud husband and father of 2. Listen to his advice on how to be a top athlete.

Fierce Mama Warriors,"Imagine a place you could visit where you walk out knowing you're made of the right stuff and ready to ROCK it as a mother! Imagine a hub where you could connect directly with motherhood wellness STARS who are dedicated to serving you at the highest level along your motherhood journey! If you could imagine such a place - that is the Fierce Mama Warriors podcast. I am SO excited to bring you this week's episode (I know I say that every week, but it's true!) with one of my best friends, the one and only Rebecca Sigala!

She has had such an influnce on me and the way I view women's bodies... and it's really her work that started to open my mind to body positivity.

She also has an incredible way of celebrating every different type, size, and shape of a woman's body and I think it's something the world really needs right now - to see every body type in that light.

My friend Rebecca is an internationally recognized boudoir photographer whose mission it is to empower women to love themselves from the inside out! (Yay!) Through her artistic and intimate portraiture, women are given the opportunity to see their beauty in a different light. This can be an enormous milestone on their journey towards self-love and acceptance.

This incredible powerhouse of a woman currently runs an online community of over 3,500 women, has hosted workshops, and spoken in different cities about the importance of self-care, positive body image and connecting to our true selves. Teenage girls have incredibly powerful inner tools that can help keep them safe and be the most confident version of themselves. It's up to us to help equip them with the right environment and training to help them tap into this innate power! The best tool I've seen to help girls with this is Empowerment Self Defense. I am SO excited for this episode with the one and only Batya The Baby Coach (aka Batya Sherizen)! simply put, Batya is a savior! This amazing woman has been a child sleep expert for over 13 years. She helps tired, frustrated, yet loving parents regain control of their sleep and their lives by using her gentle, proven methods to help babies sleep -- and sleep FAST! So if you're listening to this episode and you're ready to be that thriving, shining parent again...then this episode is for YOU! ""It's time to stop getting up night after endless night with your baby...and it's time to start LIVING YOUR LIFE."" ... Amen, Batya! I am HONORED today to bring you the one and only Talli Rosenbaum, a renowned Individual &amp; Couples Sex Therapist! This woman is a powerhouse! And today she shares with us some deep insights from her 25+ YEARS OF EXPERIENCE in the sexual health field! This is an important one, Fierce Mama Warriors. Please note that listener discretion is advised. Enjoy! Happy New Year! I am so excited to ring in 2020 by bringing you an incredible conversation with a woman who lives and breathes her devotion to helping moms!

Naava Shafner, co-founder of ImaKadima, graced us with her time, passion, and wit to discuss what it means to be a career-minded mother and a force for good for women all over the world. On Hanukkah, I bring you some teachings about why stepping into, facing , and enduring the darkness, is the courage that comes from feminine power, and it lies deep within both men and women. My teacher has asked to remain anonymous for now, but all of her teachings are rooted in both ancient texts and modern psychology."

Anthony Trucks
 Anthony Trucks talks about overcoming foster care and then coping with having to transition after having a short professional NFL football career. “I came out of the NFL and I toured shorter. So it ended before I wanted it to, which is even worse, because I didn’t go out of my own doing. And then I tried to find myself again and unfortunately in doing so, I found that I lost a lot. Because for me it’s like I knew what I had to put in. I earned my keep in football, right? Then all of a sudden I’m in this realm where it’s like...the real world.” 
  
 On this episode of Finding Your Summit Podcast, we talk with Anthony Trucks, Retired NFL Player for the Buccaneers, Redskins, and Steelers, President &amp; CEO of Anthony Trucks Industries, Author, Speaker, Coach, and Current American Ninja Warrior on NBC. Anthony Trucks started his own businesses and become a motivational speaker for others to benefit from. “I think a lot of people think it has to be sports or military. It could be a mom. All of a sudden your kids go to college. Who are you without driving people around all day? Maybe if you are a dad and all of a sudden you retire. Or you are a dad and your kid doesn’t need you to coach anymore. We always have these shifts and people attribute them to just the sports world. But its humanity.” 
  
 What You Will Learn:
  
 Anthony Trucks shares the physical, mental, and emotional hardships of his early life in foster care. “It was just a level of not feeling secure, not feeling stable, not feeling loved. I bounced around from house to house for three years, six different homes I was in. A lot of them were just bad people. Be starved, torchered me, like weird stuff as a kid. At six years old I got put in my family, which is my family to this day. I was not adopted until I was 14 though. So everyday you have no idea. ‘Am I going to go back to foster care, in a different house?’”
  
 Why did it take eight years for Anthony Trucks to get fully adopted by his current foster family? “For eight years I was in that house but my real mom had what’s called parental rights. Which means that she can control what I can and can’t do. Couldn’t play sports. Couldn’t take trips. Couldn’t get adopted. And so at 14, I finally let the family love me. Because for a lot of years I always wanted to go back to my real mom and I think we don’t realise that sometimes the thing you want so bad is not the greatest for you.”
  
 Anthony Trucks talks about getting arrested as a kid after hanging out with the wrong crowd and breaking into cars, which he still regrets to this day. He shares how his mindstate at that time shifted between the feeling that being a foster kid set up his life for failure and having doubt that he deserved the chance to have a good life. “‘You’re a foster kid Ant and what do foster kids do?’ You look at any prison in American, 75% of the inmates are former foster kids. Like 50% of the homeless population...foster kids. Less than 1% of us ever graduate college. So I’m not numerically set up to do anything well.”
  
 How does Anthony define real love? “I think real love has to be tough because everybody can give you false love which makes you feel good all the time. But love is like, ‘I want you to be better,’ and usually it means breaking you from the direction you feel comfortable going because that is not taking you where you want to go.”
  
 Anthony Trucks shares an touching story about the impact that his potential suicide attempt had on one of his close friends who told Anthony, “‘When I found out what was going on, I legitimately threw up. I was sick and it scared the crap out of me.’ I’m like, I’m sorry man. And he is like, ‘No, I don’t think you grasp.’ He says, ‘There is a reason, because I thought I lost a hero.’ It was reall"

 JJ vividly reminds us that the word ‘fitness’ is not just about the state of one’s physical body, but also the factors which determine a person’s overall well being.

Meg Haworth, Ph.D. is the private chef to some of the top stars, producers and directors in Hollywood. She specializes in food allergies, healing diets and healthy weight loss with food that tastes so great that her clients don’t feel like they’re missing anything. Her great passion is teaching people with food restrictions how to eat, offering delicious and healthy menu plans, grocery lists and “how to” cooking instructions along with blogs, videos and recipes.

Dr. Meg is no stranger to the difficulties of eating for health. After spending her twenties in doctors’ offices with over a dozen illnesses, she decided to take the complementary medical route to get some relief. After her nutritionist told her to remove, gluten, dairy, sugar, corn, citrus, peanuts, caffeine and alcohol from her diet, she saw massive improvements within a week.

The problem was she still did not know what to eat. In fact, her first trip to Whole Foods Market ended in tears when she saw the shelves of unrecognizable products in small packages that cost a small fortune. She left the store empty handed and pondered life’s biggest questions: “How am I going to eat pizza now? What am I going to do for a birthday cake? And, how am I going to live without chocolate chip cookies?” Well, that was just crazy talk because cookies were nonnegotiable and she was going to figure out how to have those things no matter what so she headed to the kitchen to figure it out.

In the last two decades of eating for food allergies, Dr. Meg has written a cookbook, Done with Dairy. Giving up Gluten; 14 Days to a Delicious and Healthy You, owned a country inn called Harmony Oaks in South Carolina where she had a full service restaurant serving breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert all gluten and dairy free and with produce from her organic garden. She was the first food allergy chef in a mainstream venue sharing 27 of her recipes in video on Eat, Drink or Die.com, (a spinoff of Will Ferrell’s Funny or Die.com) alongside celebrity chefs Jamie Oliver, Tom Colicchio and Paula Deen. Dr. Meg is also the national spokesperson for a line of kitchen products from Nexgenstore where she develops recipes, writes blogs, makes videos, commercials, and hosts live events demonstrating their products.

Dr. Meg holds a Ph.D. in Transpersonal Psychology (Holistic Psychology) and an undergraduate degree in English with a concentration in writing and minors in both psychology and social work. She studied cooking privately with Russell Washington at her country inn and worked in the test kitchen at Authentic Foods, a gluten free flour company. She grew up in a southern family of foodies where no one measured anything and everything tasted amazing and that’s just how she believes healthy cooking should be.

Carrie’s website: https://www.carriemontgomery.com I love it when I meet like-minded women that I can have an open and honest discussion with. Maria Tan is one of those women and we sat down and talked about the evolutions we have been over the past few years. While we have only knew each other a few years, we've both made some major life decisions that lead have to changes that took us out of ""hustle mode"" and helped both of us to start living a life of harmony and confidence (and maybe a hint of rebellion!). I am closing out the year strong with this episode! Have you ever found yourself jumping from goal to goal and wondering why you're still struggling to accomplish anything? You are not alone; most people struggle because they don't have a clear vision of where they want to be. They don't create goals that will lead them to a specific end. If you're one of those people, this episode is for you.

Jaring de Groot Training 3

3 x 10 minuten hurdrinne, tuskentroch 2 minuten kuierje

Jaring de Groot: ""Tips om troch te setten""

De Simmer yn Fryslân-loop komt no echt tichtby. Bist der al hielendal klear foar of komme der toch wat 'kleine pijntjes' om de hoeke sjen? Bliuw posityf en hâld de gedachte fêst datst it kinst. Hâld dy ek goed oan it trainingsprogramma en doch seker net mear as dat yn it programma stiet. De bedoeling is sels om wat gas werom te nimmen, om dy sa wat rêst te jaan foar de dei fan 13 septimber dêr't it gebeure moat. Dizze wiken binne miskien wol it swierst. Eins bist der fierhinne klear foar, mar moast dy noch efkes wat ynhâlde. Mar it komt goed.

Dan is de Simmer yn Fryslân-loop op 13 septimber foarby, en dan...? Is soe spitich wêze dat de basis fan 5 kilometer hurdrinne ferlern giet. Kinst foar dysels trochgean mei hurdrinnen en bliuw dat minimaal twa kear per wike dwaan. Stadichoan kinst de ôfstân dan wat fierder útwreidzje.

Mar in soad minsken ha toch in 'stok achter de doar' nedich. Dan is in rinklup in oanrieder. Yn Fryslân binne tal fan atletykferienings en ringroepen aktyf. Sport Fryslân hat hjir wol in goed oersjoch fan. It foardiel fan in ringroep is dus dy 'stok', mar ek it foardiel fan mei-inoar rinne. Seker yn de winterperioade is dat noflik. Boppedat kinst ûnderling wat kompetysje oangean, is it sosjale aspekt belangryk en is it leuk om mei in groep nei in wedstriid ta te gean. En je kinne ûnderfinings yn it hurdrinne útwikselje. Koartsein in soad foardielen om nei de Simmer yn Fryslân-loop by in ringroep oan te sluten.

Jaring de Groot Training 2

2 x 15 minuten hurdrinne, tuskentroch 3 minuten (Dizze wike mar twa trainingen fan ús kant. Ast wolst, kinst fansels altyd wat kuierje, fytse of swimme.)

Coach Jaring de Groot oer de tarieding foar de Simmer yn Fryslân-loop

Noch in pear wike en dan stiest oan de start fan de Simmer yn Fryslân-loop, ûnderdiel fan de BurgumRun. Dyn earste offisjele hurdrinwedstriid. Best wol spannend, mar sjoch it foaral as in útdaging datst hjir oan mei dwaan meist. Hjirby in pear oandachtspunten dy't wy dy no al mei jaan wolle.

• Sjoch al ris efkes op de lokaasje dêr't it evenemint holden wurdt (Elektrisiteitssintrale Burgum, Koumarwei 2). Sa krigest in bytsje in idee wat it is. Kinst ek op de site www.burgumrun.nl sjen. Dêr stiet ek fan alles op by 'foto/video' fan de ôfrûne acht jier.

• Sjoch ek ris op de site www.burgumrun.nl foar de rûte yn Google Maps. En sa mooglik kinst de rûte yn it foar ek al fytse!

• Tink al fêst nei hoe de wedstriid oer 5 km ferrinne moat. Hast no hiel wat trainingen hân. Wurdt it in kwestje fan útrinne op in leech tempo. Ynstek is dan om it gewoan te heljen. Kinst ek foar in opbou kieze troch stadich te begjinnen en geandewei de 5 kilometer it tempo wat op te fieren. Rin wol dyn eigen tempo en lit dy net meislepe troch oare hurdrinners. Se kinne in hiel oar doel ha wat it wedstriidferrin oanbelanget.

• Tink ek alfêst nei oer de hurdrinklean foar de wedstriid. It is no noch net dúdlik wat it waar wurde sil op 13 septimber, mar ien ding is wol wis; it wurdt net kâld. Lit dy foaral liede troch de klean dy'tst by de trainingen oan hân hast. En wolst noch wat nijs keapje, doch dat dan no, want dan kinst it noch oan ha mei de training. En kinst fiele as it goed sit.

• Bring famyljeleden en kennissen op de hichte fan it feit datst meidochtst oan de Simmer yn Fryslân-loop. Se kinne dy dizze lêste wiken noch stypje en op de dei sels is it natuerlik moai dat se dy oer de finish kommen sjogge.

• En... genietsje oer in pear wiken fan de Simmer yn Fryslân-loop. It makket net út op it hoefolste plak ast oer de finish komst. Elkenien is in winner. En de ûnderfining is meastentiids dat der nei dy noch hiel wat minsken oer de finish komme moatte.

Fit mit Laura,"Herzlich Willkommen zu meinem Podcast ""Fit mit Laura"". Dieser Podcast dreht sich rund um die Themen Ernährung, Fitness und Gesundheit. Ich bin Laura, Ernährungsberaterin und zu meiner großen Leidenschaft zählt eine gesunde Ernährung und der Sport. Ich möchte über die Mythen der Fitnesswelt und die Diskussionen bzgl. dem Thema Ernährung aufklären, Themen wie Periodenverlust und Stress aufgreifen und vieles mehr. Außerdem bin ich natürlich jederzeit offen für Themenvorschläge von eurer Seite. Für mehr kostenlosen Content, Informationen rund um die Themen Ernährung und Fitness, Trainingsvideos sowie kostenlose gesunde Rezepte folgt mir gerne auf Instagram. @fit__laura. https://www.instagram.com/fit__laura/ Die Set-Point-Theorie beschreibt die Regulation des Körpergewichtes. Diese Theorie  besagt, dass unser Gewicht genetisch festgelegt ist. Genau hier pendelt sich der Körper immer wieder ein, denn hier funktionieren unsere Prozesse optimal. 
Was ist dran an der Theorie für unser Idealgewicht? Gibt es für jeden von uns ein individuelles Sollgewicht? Doch wie kommen dann Exreme, wie Übergewicht oder Anorexie, zustande?
In dieser Podcast-Folge erfahrt ihr mehr über die Set-Point Theorie und was wirklich dahinter steckt. Für manche kann das Kalorienzählen sinnvoll sein, doch andere belastet es und es wird für sie zum Zwang. Für die meisten ist es nicht so einfach, von heute auf morgen mit dem Zählen aufzuhören. Es ist eine gewisse Gewohnheit, ein Zwang es zu machen. Deswegen gebe ich dir in dieser Podcast-Folge wertvolle Tipps, wie du es schaffen kannst, davon loszukommen. In dieser Episode geht es darum, für welche Personengruppen das Kalorienzählen tatsächlich Sinn machen kann und wann es dabei helfen kann, seine Ziele zu erreichen. Jedoch gibt es auch gewisse Kritikpunkte und Personengruppen, denen ich davon eher abraten würde. Was sind überhaupt Kalorien? Warum spielen Kalorien eine Rolle? Und müssen wir Kalorien zählen um abzunehmen? Diese Fragen und mehr bespreche ich in dieser Podcast-Episode mit euch. Silvester und Neujahr sind beliebte Tage für gute, neue Vorsätze. Gesünder leben, mehr Sport, abnehmen usw. Doch leider werden diese Vorhaben nach ein paar Tagen bereits über Bord geworfen. Wie kann man seine Gewohnheiten wirklich ändern? 
Und was habe ich das letzte Jahr an wertvollen Erfahrungen und neuen Gewohnheiten mitgenommen? Außerdem möchte ich euch in dieser Folge einen Tipp mitgeben, wie ihr auch gezielte Vorsätze motiviert in das neue Jahr starten könnt. Happy New Year meine Lieben! Erstmal wünsche ich euch allen natürlich Frohe Weihnachten und ein wunderschönes Weihnachtsfest mit euren Liebsten! Ich möchte euch mit dieser Podcast Folge helfen, Weihnachten nicht mit negativen Gefühlen verbinden zu müssen. Wie kannst du die Anspannung, den Stress oder deine Ängste hinsichtlich der Ernährung oder dem Sport loslassen?"

“By breathing through your nose, you can take up to 30% more oxygen.” –James Breese A new year is a good time to set new goals for yourself, and many of those goals revolve around fitness. However, it’s well known that New Year’s resolutions aren’t always effective – a very large number of them fail every year. If you’re thinking about setting fitness-related resolutions for yourself this year, what you need to do is learn how to stick to an exercise routine like a pro. Listen in to hear Josh and James discuss why New Year’s resolutions fail, why you have a better chance of success if you start with simple habits, and why you should focus more on ritual than on results.

“You can drag them with you, but you can sometimes be dragged down by the people closest to you at the same time.” –James Breese

“See what happens when you do make your bed every day. See what happens after that.” –James Breese You hear a lot about the importance of cardio, but how do you get started with cardio if you’re a beginner over 30? You may have noticed that it’s harder to do things that you previously did easily. You may even be telling yourself that you “used to be able” to do those cardio-related exercises, but not anymore.

Listen to today’s conversation with James Breese to learn why it’s time to remove “I used to” from your vocabulary, why you may not want to jump straight into running with no preparation, and how to make cardio more enjoyable.

“Essentially cardio is unloaded non-weight bearing exercises that raises the heart level sufficiently and allows more blood to be pumped around the body from the heart.” –James Breese

“The cardiovascular system – it takes time. It takes time to build up.” –James Breese Is online training right for you? The answer is: it depends. In today’s episode, you’ll hear more about online training, including the benefits and the disadvantages of this type of training. Listen in to find out more about what the different options for online training are, which styles of online training might be right for you, and what you might want to look for in an online trainer or training program.

“A good coach will be able to tailor the workout he may have already planned for you that day based on how you are when you walk into the room.” –James Breese

“Daily interaction is key. It’s knowing someone’s there in your back corner, supporting you no matter what you’ve done.” —James Breese Maybe you’re interested in strength training, but you’ve never done it before and you don’t know how to get started.

Whole body cryotherapy is a wellness treatment that is popular with athletes and people who suffer from chronic pain. It involves standing in a tank where temperatures drop to -212 degrees Farenheit. It is supposed to relieve pain and boost healing from injuries.

Is it really like Altered States or connecting with the Upside Down in Stranger Things? The Fit Crew has some very strong opinions on all things float spa.

But what is it, what does it taste like - and are there real benefits to turning our food and drinks a color only Kermit-the-Frog could love? And just what was Noelle drinking?

Fit za biurkiem,"Fit za biurkiem to taki projekt, który powstał jako zderzenie dwóch dyscyplin – fitnessu, z którym jestem od lat związany, poprzez moje do niego zamiłowanie oraz pracy biurowej, którą z kolei od lat wykonuję. Pomyślałem, że istnieje wiele poradników, wielu ekspertów, wiele badań naukowych oraz specjalistycznych źródeł informacji, natomiast ta klęska urodzaju sprawia, że można zostać przytłoczonym nadmiarem fachowej wiedzy, co powoduje niechęć do podjęcia działania. Chcę pokazać, że nie trzeba być sportowcem, żeby mieć dobrą sylwetkę i cieszyć się dobrym zdrowiem. Gościem dzisiejszego odcinka jest Julian Sobiech, który oprócz tego, że jest aktywny zawodowo, to jeszcze po godzinach zajmuje się uświadamianiem ludziom jak dożyć setki (ma taki profil na instagramie, który polecam obserwować), tworząc treści związane ze zdrowym stylem życia.

Ta rozmowa jest wyjątkowo gęsta w treść i obfituje w całą masę informacji, związanych z treningiem, dietą, a także ogólnym zdrowiem. Julian udzielił też kilku prostych porad, które można od ręki wdrożyć w życie i uwolnić się od uciążliwych dolegliwości bólowych.

Muszę przyznać, że jestem naprawdę pod wrażeniem tego, o ilu tematach udało nam się porozmawiać i mam nadzieję, że i Wam się ten odcinek spodoba. Gościem dzisiejszego odcinka jest Joanna Andryszczak-Lewandowska, coachini i trenerka empatycznej komunikacji. Oprócz tego jest twórczynią Siły Słuchania, gdzie tworzy treści związane z psychologią. Ta rozmowa zrobiła na mnie bardzo duże wrażenie i mam nadzieje, że Twoje odczucia będą zbieżne z moimi i odnajdziesz tu dla siebie wartość. Zapraszam do słuchania!

W wolnym czasie gra w piłkę oraz eksperymentuje kulinarnie. Niestety, problemy techniczne sprawiły, że ścieżka Szymona nie grzeszy najlepszą jakością - pozostaje jedynie za to przeprosić.
Poruszamy tematy wolności wyboru, kwestii istotności podejmowania decyzji i ciągłego działania. To naładowana energią rozmowa pełna pasji i zajawki. Gościem dzisiejszego odcinka jest Alina Osowska, trenerka oraz ekspertka w kwestii autoprezentacji w biznesie. Wraz ze wspólniczką, Marleną Momot, prowadzi firmę Autokreacja. Oprócz tego, że jest świetna w tym co robi, dba także o swoje zdrowie i kondycję - jeździ na rowerze i trenuje na siłowni.
W naszej rozmowie poruszamy temat organizacji czasu, motywacji do treningów oraz skąd czerpać wiedzę w tym zakresie. Gościem dzisiejszego odcinka jest Piotr Kantorowski, radca prawny, który prowadzi Kancelarię Prawną Kantorowski, Głąb i Wspólnicy, a także podcast Prawo dla Biznesu. Oprócz tego jest mężem i ojcem dwójki dzieci, a sportowo angażuje się w bieganie.
Rozmawiamy o porannych nawykach, organizacji czasu, biznesie, a także o książkach. Zapraszam do słuchania. Formuła tego podcastu jest taka, że zapraszam gości, którzy pracują pełną parą, są zajęci, ale znajdują czas na to, żeby dbać o siebie, uprawiać sport i, krótko mówiąc, być fit. W związku z tym, że jest to odcinek zero, wcielę się w nim w rolę gościa, natomiast prowadzenie obejmie mój wspólnik - Piotr Piasecki."

FIT.nl podcast: verander je leefstijl!,"In deze podcast serie interviewt team FIT.nl coaches en experts met inspirerende verhalen en handige tips om meer uit jezelf te halen. In deze aflevering gaan we in gesprek met Jacob Veenstra. Hij is coach en triatleet en vertelt in deze podcast over de levenslessen en ervaring van de voorbereiding op de Ironman. De helft van de Nederlanders is te zwaar. Sterker, als we niet ingrijpen, zal dit groeien tot tweederde in 2040. De overheid gaat dit probleem aanpakken, maar dit zal bij lange na niet genoeg zijn, is de conclusie van Marten Houkes na grondig onderzoek. 

Coach Erik en Jeroen waren razend nieuwsgierig en gingen met hem in gesprek. Marten is medisch psycholoog en heeft zich maanden verdiept in de effectiviteit van de gecombineerde leefstijlinterventie (GLI). 
 
Onderwerpen
Wat is de de gecombineerde leefstijlinterventie en wat is er goed aan? 
Is het een effectieve manier om overgewicht tegen te gaan?
Waar liggen de verbeterpunten? 
Wat zou de overheid buiten de GLI nog meer kunnen doen om dit probleem tegen te gaan
Meer weten over Marten?
Bekijk hier zijn LinkedIn pagina. Of neem contact met hem op via zijn e-mail. In deze podcast behandelen we het thema stress. Uit een onderzoek van het CBS blijkt namelijk dat het aantal mensen met stressklachten tussen 2015 en 2017 met zo’n 3 procent is gestegen. Dat verbaast ons niet want iedereen zegt tegenwoordig dat ze het zo druk hebben. Maar hoe kan dat eigenlijk, want we hebben toch zo goed? Vandaag gaat Jeroen in gesprek met Auke Toussaint. Auke is CrossFit atleet en was in 2016 de fitste man van Nederland. Hij vertelt je over de lessen die hij heeft geleerd van het presteren op het toppen van je kunnen. Hoe zorg je ervoor dat je alles uit jezelf haalt maar niet geblesseerd of overtraind raakt? Vandaag gaan Erik en Jeroen in gesprek met Astrid Postma-Smeets. Zij is Expert Voeding &amp; Gezondheid van het Voedingscentrum. In deze aflevering bespreken we de beoordeling van voedingsonderzoek, de rol van het Voedingscentrum en de toekomst van voedingsadvies in Nederland.  Deze week gaan Erik en Jeroen in gesprek met hoogleraar Andries Kalsbeek van de Universiteit van Amsterdam. Andries is gespecialiseerd in chronobiologie en heeft interessant onderzoek gedaan naar de invloed van de biologische klok op eetgedrag, overgewicht en gezondheid. "

Fitness and More,"Fitness is more than just a work out, it's a lifestyle committed to health by staying active, eating healthy, reducing stress and having fun. Catherine Sanson is a Registered Nurse, mother and fitness enthusiast who believes that most diseases and ailments can be prevented by eating healthy nutrient packed foods, proper hydration, incorporating a daily exercise routine, meditation/deep breathing, relaxation techniques and adequate sleep. She teaches the Wim Hof Breathing Technique,  a technique that is pure science and simple to incorporate in your everyday life. It will help heal your injuries, pain will decrease, respiratory and immune system will become more efficient. You will feel connected to your body, heart, mind and be left with a feeling of euphoria, sense of calmness and peace. It’s a simple technique already done in hospitals when you go in for an illness, injury or disease process. This process can rejuvenate the cells of the body by giving it one of the important ingredients of life, OXYGEN.

 To help you achieve realistic results she developed the NOWES system, a systematic, back to basic living and eating method that will quickly get you to feel and live a fitter and healthier life. The NOWES system is like a jump-start to a deeper understanding of the basic physiological, mental and individualized techniques that will help you achieve an improved, intuitive sense of your own body. It’s the A,B,C’s of living.

 She placed 3rd in the 2005 GNC California State Championships and 11th with the New York Team Universe and out of about 30 competitors in her class.

Brandon is a star on YouTube as Shakelightly channel because he is THE biggest “fitness dork” of the world or is he? Actually, Brandon is smart and sly as a fox. You will love watching his videos and I am sure his radio interview will be as good.

Brandon likes to think of himself as a comedian and fitness extraordinaire. He makes people laugh with his goofball antics and he is extraordinarily fit (if you don’t mind him saying so), so he credits himself with both. He’s modest

For the past 11 years, he has been a fitness fanatic. Recently, thanks to YouTube, he has been able to inspire millions of people all over the world by showing them that people with big muscles can also be big dorks. Brandon has received hundreds upon hundreds of messages thanking him for the inspiration to get in shape and commending him on his outspoken criticism of what the fitness industry has become. His videos have been viewed a total of over 2,000,000 times.

His mission is to help current and future generations of young adults see through the deceptive marketing techniques used by the fitness industry today and revert back to the basics which hi idol, Jack LaLanne, championed.

In today’s world where anyone can be labeled as an expert, he would  rather be defined as an “Average Joe” with above average inspiration to enjoy life and stay in shape.

This is the edited show version with just the Kanzius interview.

My guest, Mark Neidig, Executive Director

Cancer cells are being KILLED/DESTROYED by radio waves. The process is ready for human trials. 

Learn what is next for this great discovery, how you can help and what the American Cancer Society response has been and why?

The Kanzius Cancer Research Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. It is made up of a group of dedicated individuals supporting ongoing research for the Kanzius Non-invasive Radio Wave Treatment project; a treatment without any side effects. Our mission is to create national and global awareness of the potentials of this treatment and to raise funds to help accelerate the speed at which research progresses through human trials. We believe that by acting together in support of continuing research and development, we can make a difference in the lives of people who suffer from this disease.

Find them on Facebook as KanzisCancerResearch Foundation Carolyn Scott-Hamilton celebrated her 10 years as a vegan as well as an entrepreneur in 2009.  After college, Carolyn moved to Los Angeles from Miami in 1998.  Shortly after arriving and becoming vegan, she studied holistic nutrition as well as dabbled in the culinary arts before she opened Ineventions, originally a pr &amp; event firm, it is now a full film, TV and web production branch under the umbrella of her original business.  With the access and addition of the new business arm, Carolyn was able to start realizing her dream of traveling and eating all over the world and so the Healthy Voyager was born in 2005.

Carolyn is an avid traveler but she found it quite difficult to find vegan friendly restaurants abroad.  She tired of having to pack her own foods or eat bread, fries and junky foods when she was away.  After realizing she could find and/or manipulate any menu to create a meal that satisfied her as well as her dining partners, she created the Healthy Voyager to show people that your dietary restrictions should not ruin you or your travel mates’ trip, be it business or pleasure. She also realized it was a great resource for those who were traveling with others who did not share their special needs as her posts offered suggestions to restaurants that shared options for all types of foodies. As of 2006, she &amp; her husband, of opposing gastronomic tastes, have traveled and dined healthily and harmoniously while documenting it all on film for the Healthy Voyager Web Series and growing the Healthy Voyager brand.

To connect with the Healthy Voyager, you may email her at Carolyn@healthyvoyager.com . Sorry no callers.

In his debut book ""For the Fit but Personal Trainer: A Guide on How to Train Money - Not Muscle - to Grow"", Nelson Toriano teaches readers how to manage their revenue stream to avoid burnout. In this episode, we discuss a few chapters of his book but we just scratch the surface. This is a valuable episode if you're wondering if you've made the right decision in becoming a personal trainer or if you simply need to clean up your financials.

Fitness e dintorni,"News e approfondimenti su fitness, allenamento e alimentazione, incluse le puntate della mia rubrica radio del martedì ""Il risveglio muscolare"". Le tecniche motivazionali di visualizzazione permettono un dimagrimento 5 volte più efficace anche a 6 mesi dal trattamento. Il regime chetogenico e la dieta paleo spopolano in palestra e sui social, ma la ricerca scientifica ci mette in guardia dai possibili rischi. Il sovrappeso ha delle chiare ed evidenti ripercussioni anche nei rapporti di coppia, sebbene uomini e donne abbiano un approccio differente al sovrappeso del partner. Da uno studio su risonanze magnetiche eseguite su giovani in sovrappeso è emerso un danno visibile nel corpo calloso. Il modo migliore per tornare in forma è dimenticarsi della dieta… proprio in senso letterale! La cintura utilizzata nel bodybuilding ha specifiche funzioni, ma molto più di frequente espone a rischi sottovalutati."
Fitness e Life Coaching,"Abbiamo tutto quello che ti serve per migliorare! E così questo meraviglioso, fantastico percorso è giunto al suo arrivo. Emiliano ha fatto con successo il suo primo triathlon e qui ci racconta come è andata: sensazioni e strategie. Noi vi diamo appuntamento alla prossima sfida e vi ricordiamo che se volete perdere quel dannato chiletto di troppo, siamo con voi!

Fitness For Normal People,"this is a podcast for people who who want to be healthier, fitter and leaner without it completely taking over their lives. Dan and Vanessa have teamed up to give you straight forwards and easy to follow practically advice for you to reach your fitness goals. Vanessa and I started a Podcast last year.

This year, things went a bit mental for our businesses and we've not really been able to keep up with everything.

Plus, some injuries and other life stuff have stopped us from doing certain things.

One thing that has remained relatively on point is nutrition.

Here we talk about how I make excuses, how Vanessa prioritises certain aspects of her life when other things take over - like business or being a busy mum, plus how normal people could potentially improve their lifestyles when things go a bit awry. In this episode Dan and Vanessa talk about setting yourself to win in January.  

We talk about setting goals, how often you should work out and lots of tips so you are successful in reaching your goals. Dan and Vanessa talks about alcohol and how you can incorporate it into your lifestyle and still see results.

Fitness M/K,"Fitness M/K er Danmarks første og største podcast om sports, fitness og træning. Den startede som podcast hos det nu hedengangne Radio24syv, men Fitness M/K lever videre som uafhængig podcast. Følg med PhD Anders Nedergaard aka Dr. Muskel ind i træningens verden, hvor vi snakker sportsvidenskab, bodybuilding, fitness, ernæring, sportsernæring og underlige sportsgrene. Kroppen og alle de ting vi gør ved den for at gøre den større, mindre, hurtigere, vildere farligere har altid fascineret mennesket og nu mere end nogensinde. Tag lidt fitness i ørerne og lyt med. På efterhånden utallige opfordringer har Fitness M/K har Simon supertrainer/bigshooter, der efterhånden er en slags kendis på den del af det danske internet, hvor man diskuterer bodybuilding. Han er kendt for sin spidse facon og sarkasme, men også for sin enorme viden om træning og helt sindssyge dedikation til at ville være større og stærkere, uden iøvrigt at ville bruge det til at stille op til bodybuyilding konkurrencer, score damer, eller høste internet point. I det forrige afsnit blev vi ikke færdige og istedet for at haste os igennem det afsnit, tog vi os tid til dette også. Rent faktisk havde vi så meget mere at snakke om at dette afsnit blev det hidtil længste på Fitness M/K. Vi kommer lidt mere detaljeret ind i på programlægningen, det software de bruger i tyskland til at monitorere træning, løfteanalyse og endelig den tyske ARD-dokumentar Der Herr der Heber om doping i international vægtløftning. Fitness M/K har haft besøg af Simon Darville, der er en af Danmarks bedste vægtløftere på herresiden. Han har boet og trænet i Tyskland, som en del af deres talentudviklingssystem. Han giver nogle spændende perspektiver på det tyske system for talentudvikling i forhold til det danske og vi diskuterer nogle af de ""skoler"", der eksisterer og har eksisteret i forskellige lande indenfor træningsplanlægning og mere overordnet træningskultur. Vi nåede ikke at blive færdige, så udsendelsen er den før Fitness M/K har endnu engang haft besøg af professor og idrætshistoriker Hans Bonde. Vi tager afsæt i hans forrige besøg, hvor vi snakkede om hans dengang kommende bog om det danske idrætsikon fra det forrige århundredeskifte, nemlig IP Müller. Nu er han blevet færdig med bogen og vi fortsætter fra sidst. I udsendelsen hører vi blandt andet om hvordan Müller kommercielt lå i konkurrence med Eugene Sandow, der blev oldefaren til den moderne bodybuilding. Det er blevet tid til endnu et årsskifte og dermed tid til nytårskuren. Til dette års nytårskur har vi fået besøg af dregene fra Ghetto fitness, Kian og MJ. Jeg kan godt afsløre at der ikke bliver snakket så meget træning, men vi kommer omkring forskelle i kropskultur mellem indvandrere og kartofler, om det at være (sygeligt) optaget af hvor jacked man ser ud, om hvad mænd og kvinder kigger efter i det modsatte køn og så fik jeg lært Kian at drikke Linie akvavit. Der er flere og flere der døjer med irritabel tyktarm, eller også er der ihvertfald flere der snakker om det. Så meget at det selv har sneget sig ind i BB-miljøet i form af vertical diet (og John Meadows' kostråd), hvor man ellers altid bare har betragtet mad som brændstof og byggesten.

Den gruppe af næringsstoffer der kaldes FODMAPs, er typisk synderen i irritabel tyktarm. Vi har besøg af klinisk diætist Stine Junge Albrechtsen, til en snak om irritabel tyktarm og FODMAP diæten/kostkonceptet."

Fitness Mentor,"The world of health and fitness has become confusing and hostile. Being able to navigate vast amounts of information and understand what is useful can be a full time job. Join bestselling author and founder of Hybrid Fitness, Tommy Caldwell, as he helps listeners cut through the noise of the industry in diet, exercise, fitness philosophy and behavior change. You don't need a coach. You don't need an 'influencer'. You need a mentor. Thank you for making the Fitness Mentor Podcast one of iTunes top 40 all-time downloaded shows! In this episode, Tommy discusses his experience on the Carnivore Diet. He details his view of the carnivore community, his personal experience with the diet, and who he recommends to try and avoid the approach. Questions asked on this Q and A episode:

I find that I tend to eat the same food on a daily basis, which i don't mind. Does this matter? Will my body become accustomed to certain foods, at a certain times- daily? Is there reason to ""shock"" your body by mixing it up?

I have alway paired protein/carb for snacks..fruit/cottage cheese, peanut butter/apple. Is this ok?

If I exercise fasted, should I continue fasting after the workout or do I need to get my protein in as it is commonly stated?

How much protein should be consumed before and after a workout, and what kinds?

What does a women need to know or do in her 40’s that may be different than when she was in her 30’s?

What’s the difference between steel cut and regular or quick oats?

Can you eat too much tofu?

If you could make just one behavioral change suggestion for someone who struggles with snacking and mindless eating, what would it be? In this episode, Tommy walks through a few self-assessment options you can use in place of traditional resolutions for great goal attainment. He even gives examples of his own personal 2019 self-assessment that are quite personal. In this episode, Tommy shares his thoughts on the popular products that are advertised to consumers in the new year. He covers how the body detoxifies itself, compounds that have actually been shown to assist in this process, and what you need to do if you're truly interested in protecting your body from modern environmental toxins. In this episode, Tommy talks all things fasting- from his own experience- to the potential benefits and negatives of both intermittent, time restricted, and longer term fasting protocols. In the intro episode of the Fitness Mentor Podcast, Tommy discusses the growing issue of identity politics in the dietary world; particularly between the extreme 'right' and 'left' of the nutrition world. He also gives his thoughts on how the listener can formulate his or her diet in the most effective way."

Fitness sin Edad,"Fitness sin limites a cualquier edad !! Ese Podcast te pasa toda la informacion para estar en forma y alimentarte bien enfocado a personas arriba de los 40. Hecho por Ole Kurzidim y contactame tambien via email: olemex@picknick-im-kopf.de Hola a todos, 


Gracias por conectarse nuevamente conmigo! Hoy voy de como pueden hacer el siguiente paso para MEJORAR su bienestar, alimentación y salud física. 


Hoy se trata de TACOS Y TABATA y seguramente la primera palabra no necesita una introducción. Pero que es TABATA? Bueno, es un tipo de entrenamiento físico de alto impacto el cual normalemente tiene un  circuito de 4 minutos.


Lo bueno es que lo puedes hacer tambien en casa y te toma realmente muy poco tiempo dándote inmediatamente un efecto positivo a tu cuerpo. 


Y siempre se pueden hacer 1 - 2 circuitos de TABATA, sumando solamente 8 minutos !!


Como funciona? Eso es un ejemplo, por supuesto lo pueden variar como ustedes gusten. Previamente escoges algunos ejercicios de Bodyweight (entonces ejercicios que puedes hacer sin peso/equipo) y programas un timer en tu reloj o celular. 


Hasta ya hay tanto en Youtube, Spotify o iTunes Canciones/Videos para Tabata. Igual en Pinterest encuentran muchas rutinas ejemplo...escogen y prueban la que mas que les llame la atención y prueben. Abajo les pongo 2 - 3 recomendaciones mías las cuales integro continuamente a mi rutina. 


Los intervalos en un circuito clásico son de 20 segundos de ejercicio seguido por 10 segundos de descanso. Así que durante 4 minutes logras hacer 8 ejercicios. 


Ejemplo para un TABATA Bodyweight Training

20 segundos - Squats / Sentadillas 

10 segundos pausa


20 segundos -  Push-ups / Lagartijas

10 segundos pausa


20 segundos -  Plank / Plancha

10 segundos pausa


20 segundos - Squats / Sentadillas 

10 segundos pausa


20 segundos -  Push-ups / Lagartijas

10 segundos pausa


20 segundos -  Plank / Plancha 

10 segundos pausa


20 segundos - Squats / Sentadillas 

10 segundos pausa


20 segundos -  Push-ups / Lagartijas

10 segundos pausa

LISTO


Pueden incluir por supuesto mas ejercicios, aqui importante es que pueden cambiar de un ejercicio al otro solo en esos 10 segundos de pausa.


Otros ejercicios para el TABATA podrían ser&gt;

Carrera en el sitio (elevando las rodillas); Saltando Cuerda; Crunches; Sentadilla con salto; Plancha lateral; Russian Twist; ...


Traten de hacer un Tabata con 3 Max 4 ejercicios, en mi experiencia de esa manera es mas fácil seguir con el Timer. 


A mi personalmente me gusta hacer una pequeña variación al TABATA, yo pongo mi timer en mi reloj a 45 segundos con 15 segundos de descanso. Me di cuenta que para mi intervalos de 20 segundos es muy poco y no logro una buena conexión mente-cuerpo. Al solo aumentar por poco el tiempo del intervalo, me siento mejor...claro es mas difícil pero al final de entonces 8 minutos (para 8 ejercicios) trabaje mejor. Igual lo pueden probar y díganme como les ha funcionado. 


Ok ok...ahora y que hacemos con los Tacos? Bueno, muy fácil ....eviten comer por gula, comen por el gusto de la comida !! De lo contrario, toda actividad deportista sigue sin efecto. Ojalá les guste este episodio, por favor denme una evaluación en iTunes porque solamente así mi Podcast sube en el ranking y mas personas podrán encontrarlo.

Sharing and discussing topics that challenges the status quo as well as the direction of the community moving towards dealing with such issues.

Raw Chef Andrea Lee is the ultimate Addict to clean treats! 
The Clean Addicts – Wholefoods Bakery started with Andrea’s Mum who suffered from clogged arteries and had to be sent to the hospital for surgery. Seeing her fragile state, this incident caused her to switch to a healthier lifestyle overnight.
 
She believes how food can be our medicine, but it wasn't an easy feat.
It was difficult to compromise her love for desserts! Andrea always had a hard time finding healthier alternatives that contain minimal ingredients, and no preservatives or refined sugars in Singapore.
After countless of late night experimentations, she managed to produce wholesome and guilt-free versions of brownies and cakes that her family and friends can't resist! 
She uses real whole foods for her desserts, such as nuts, beans, rolled oats and even sweet potatoes that come with a myriad of health benefits that are filling and natural sweeteners like dates and stevia that are low on the Glycemic Index.
With Clean Addicts’ cakes, you can say goodbye to crazy sugar rushes from conventional cakes which contain cups and cups of icing sugar!
Andrea went on to exploring more about Raw food and became obsessed.
She is a certified Raw Food Chef with certifications from leading vegan culinary school — Matthew Kenney Culinary Academy and Sayuri Healing Foods. 
She specialises in fermented foods and “cheesecakes"" made with no cheese or added sugars! She also loves experimenting with cake flavours (watch out for our seasonal flavours) and feeding her loved ones with healthy desserts that she whips up.
Through The Clean Addicts, Andrea strives to share that healthful treats can be tasty and DO NOT have to taste like cardboard.  Clean eating with natural wholefoods can be addictive and good for the body!
Eat and Feel Good with us. Be a Clean Addict!

Music Credits:  Poppin Bottles by Wolves IS THERE REALLY A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ICE AND WARM BATHES?
Yes there is! Imagine showering in freezing cold and very warm water. The differences are huge! If that is the case then you should know that these differences can also be applied to within your body system. The body not only reacts on the surface but under your skin as well.
By understanding the mechanisms of each. You'll have a better understanding of what works best for you and why you should use it. You should not take everything seen online or on Google as 100% right! Always do your research to find out why it is done that way and is it beneficial for you!

At this point in the research world, there isn’t much done toward looking deep into sports massage and it’s sub-types.
E.g. For sports massage alone if you break it down. It can be broken into effleurage, petrissage, cross-friction and tapotement and it’s various other sub-categories.
Also, much of the research done are quantitative not qualitative which can also be subjective based on external factors causing answers to vary in questionnaires.
With that being said, bias in research can occur if it isn’t a neutral party.

Today, we discuss about the debate between Bret Contreras and Naudi Aguilar, their practices which we'll touch a little bit on and how it can be of benefit to you. At the same time the other view points of how it may also affect you if not done properly.
These is for anyone that wants to understand a little bit better what was discussed and if you believe in their practice to be able to also question it a little bit more without just purely accepting it as fact. Yes, they have done pretty impressive research. We don't look down on that, in fact even more motivated by it.
We would love to have a podcast interview with both of them one day too! Cause they are individuals that have thoughts similar to us and would definitely want to shake up the industry. To make change, we need to have ideas and methods that can create this change.
Have a listen and do share your thoughts with us!

Disclaimer: All videos were recorded, edited and produced by The Posture Lab. MANY DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WHEN WE HEAR PHYSIOTHERAPIST AND/OR CHIROPRACTOR!
What does each professional really do in their own line or work? What assumptions are there when it comes to rehabilitation?
Do you know if you should be going to a Physiotherapist or Chiropractor?
Or do you simply have no idea which you should be going to because you don't what they actually do?
Just to make it a little tougher!
There are other professionals in the medical industries above and beyond these two professions.
To better understand why sometimes it isn't simply just deciding to go to one and not both is a simple case bad education, marketing that throws you off making good decisions and of course the quacks out there that basically causes the industry to be tarnished or frowned upon. With any professions, there will always be bad apples. 
Have a listen to better understand the similarities and differences and also the knowledge that each professional has. Always ask questions before committing to any form of rehabilitative service. Know what you are getting into and what you'll be getting out of it. Why? You paid money for it and deserve far more than you think you should be getting.

We tend to like to stick to our bubbles or only ask when required if not we'll simply copy or follow or like or love! As seen in the boom of the Instagram celebrities and Youtubers whom do exercises that can be simply replicated a thousand times over. But there is a missing area that is rarely touched upon which is to deal with educating the mass public about how to really deal with problems in exercise, diets, nutrition and basic functional based movements.
Very often, we like to stick to what is COOL or HIP in the industry. Often, the more POPS or DOPE it is in the industry. The more you see people gravitating toward it. Not knowing fully what it is really about. For one, everything we see in the industry of fitness now is either stuck of the AESTHETICS or to have SWEAT!
It is almost madness to believe that by simply looking good and having a sweat that you are essentially a much healthier person! That assumption alone needs to be smashed because it isn't!

Fitness Unplugged @byjschristensen,"Alt om fitness, kost, træning, vægttab - og hvad der nu ligger derind i mellem. Podcasten er tænkt som et redskab til vidensdeling, så du som lytter kan gå fra hvert program med lidt nye redskaber i bagagen ifht. din egen fitnessrejse. I programmet vil du blive introduceret til spændende gæster som du forhåbentligt kan lære en masse af, eller måske bare få et godt grin med ind i mellem. Beklager de første 10-15 min. På forhånd, al teknikken drillede voldsomt og jeg kom direkte fra at have siddet og bøvlet med en printer i 2 timer...
Og selvom jeg egentlig er en meget tålmodig mand så er der én ting jeg ikke er god til, og det er teknik der ikke virker. Så spol lidt frem, og få ellers et godt grin. 

Til sidst i podcasten er der nogle rigtig gode pointer om det at starte livsstilsændring og vægttab lige op til en højtid.

Lyt med, og rigtig god fornøjelse"
Fitness x Business,"Fitness x Business! Listen as MassiveJoes CEO, Joseph Mencel, and other members of Team MassiveJoes explore topics from both Fitness and Business in the Health & Fitness Industry. Joseph Mencel &amp; Aaron Polites discuss dealing with the highest of highs and the lowest of lows all while embracing the journey along the way. Fresh off his Top 10 placing at the 2019 Mr Olympia, Aaron experienced one of the worst anti-climaxes of his life, spiralling into a state of super low motivation. He details what he did to pull himself out of the hole and get back on top of his mindset, in particular the small positive actions he implemented each and every day that compounded on top of each other week after week. Joseph &amp; Aaron discuss why being present and embracing the journey, whether it be good or bad, is much more important than chasing destinations, and how to balance a long term, marathon mindset, with short term speed &amp; execution. They then change gears and discuss the current state of the Pro Athlete circuit in the world of bodybuilding, and why it is becoming so much more difficult for Pro Athletes to attract good sponsors. They close out their conversation with a chat about balancing confidence with humility, and using different tools &amp; techniques to keep yourself grounded regardless of the magnitude of your achievements. A broad ranging, entertaining &amp; insightful conversation that is sure to hit home on a number of different levels. Enjoy! As we head into the new decade, a lot of us are giving some thought to what we'd like to achieve over the next year, the next 5 years, and even the next 10 years. Joseph Mencel deconstructs his 5 Step Goal Setting Methodology to ensure you are setting realistic goals that are backed up with the strategy that gives you the best possible chance of achieving them. One of the most practical &amp; strategic episodes thus far. You'll want to take notes during this one. Joseph Mencel &amp; Logan Robson discuss how to balance marathon mindset with swift execution in bodybuilding, business &amp; life. With over 20 years experience in the health &amp; fitness space, Logan is one of the most respected athletes, coaches and businessmen in the industry. His competitive bodybuilding record speaks for itself, while his coaching business, Team Sacrifice, which he runs with his wife, WBFF Pro Jayne Boothby, is one of the most highly regarded coaching businesses in the country. Logan opens up about how his marathon mindset has helped him accomplish so much in such a highly competitive space, discussing patience, navigating risk, keeping all elements of life in harmony, and how he has been able to apply the lessons he has learned through bodybuilding to all areas of his life. Insightful, entertaining &amp; fascinating, turn the volume up and enjoy the episode. Joseph Mencel &amp; Jake Nikolopoulos talk everything bodybuilding, balance, self belief, and backing yourself when making difficult decisions. As an IFBB Pro Bodybuilider, former NABBA Pro Bodybuilder, and NABBA Universe Champion, Jake has over 15 years' experience in competitive bodybuiliding and immense respect for the sport as both an athlete and a fan. He talks about his incredible journey in bodybuilding thus far, in particular his experiences with different high level coaches, while addressing the the role genetics play in bodybuilding and the importance of self awareness. Jake opens up about the effect bodybuilding has had on his personal relationships, both good and bad, and offers his words of wisdom on how to use the sport as a platform to get the most out of all areas of your life. He discusses his personal experiences with refusing to settle, and gives his advice on making difficult decisions, pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone, and how to instil self belief. This is an absolutely jam packed episode that you're going to want to listen to more than once - enjoy! In this final episode of The MassiveJoes Show, CEO, Joseph Mencel, interviews General Manager, Steve Mills, before he closes the current chapter of his career and moves on to the next. Steve takes us all the way back to his childhood &amp; where his passion for fitness began, while walking us through his different business ventures over the years before he joined MassiveJoes back in 2012. It's the finale, and it's well worth a listen. A wonderful send off to one of the most valuable members of Team MassiveJoes. Enjoy! In this episode of The MassiveJoes Show, CEO, Joseph Mencel, and Post Man, Steve Mills, discuss the paradox of doing the same things &amp; expecting different results. Their discussion leads to them exploring the awareness around inputs &amp; ouputs, and the consequences of certain actions. The ultimate question posed is ""why, even when we understand that certain actions will not lead to certain outcomes, do we continue along the same path?"". The answer is sure to inspire you to take an inwards look into your own actions. This is one enlightening episode! Enjoy!"

Matt talks from the bottom of his heart about what Kobe Bryant meant to him, and how his death has effected his outlook on life. Put onto the path of fitness through his brother, Sumair Bahsin idealised the way someone could be totally free in the way they moved.

But that journey from idea to reality was no easy task. Battled by racism at school, the idea of fitness not being a suitable career choice by his family, and the sudden death of his brother...

Sumair faced all odds to get to where is today.

As the owner and founder of TrainLifeFit, Sumair helps people to function properly, move pain free and elevate performance.

This guy is such a beautiful and kind human being. He poured his heart out, which definitely comes through on this episode.

Although this was a successful launch, it was before its time. While teaching fitness and doing various other biz dev projects in fitness, tech, publishing, etc Debra met her husband and business partner, Eric Von Frohlich and they proceeded to build two fitness studio based brands – Row House and EVF Performance.  
  
 As they were building those, Debra spent 5 years in NYC Tourism, under Mayor Bloomberg during his administration where the team was able to surpass tourism goals.  Debra’s direct contributions were in creating a million dollar business by generating revenue against NYC digital as well as hard assets. Partners included NYC businesses large and small, looking to reach NYC visitors from near and far.  She was also part of the original task force who created Broadway Week, which will persevere as Restaurant Week has as a NYC economic stimulus and mainstay. In 2014, Row House opened its doors to disrupt the fitness industry. Debra ran the studios and grew the brand until 2017 went she successfully created a partnership to expand Row House through franchising.  The company is now controlled by Xponential and Debra and Eric continue to operate Row House studios in NYC. 
  
 Debra  is a mom at 3. She loves to connect people and ideas - and is keeping her eyes out for her next big one!.

FitTalk With Coach Luis,"I created this to help as many people as possible by interviewing Fitness Enthusiasts to have them share their stories! Hopefully listeners can gain some guidance in their journeys as well by hearing the obstacles and challenges others have faced along the way! Do not let yourself fail Bryan Parady, former “hopeless skinny guy” that could not put on muscle regardless what he did, shares his journey of how he learned the importance of really balancing out what he did with not just believing blindly everything he was told and how he learned nutrition is a huge part of that overall progress. Being able to balance out the day, staying focused but understanding that not every day is perfect but that we will adjust is the key to overall progress. To live to progress, isn’t that the goal? This guy really has come a long way from 118lbs (basically a wet noodle) to 165lbs! Thank you brother for taking time out of your busy schedule and talking with me about what your doing and helping others progress as well!

Dejamos atrás septiembre y con él la motivación y la euforia que traen consigo todos los comienzos de temporada. A estas alturas, quizás la fuerza de voluntad con la que empezaste la dieta tras el veranito de cañas y espetos,  empieza a flaquear. ¿Cómo puedo hacer para no saltarme la dieta? Vamos a descubrirlo.

        Acepto la política de privacidad de fittentalo.com No llego a comprender por qué somos tan ambiguos para unas cosas y tan radicales para otras. Supongo que adaptamos el mensaje según lo que nos apetece escuchar. En otros aspectos de la vida tenemos claro que el contexto de las acciones importa mucho. ¿Por qué en nutrición es diferente?
Bienvenidos al capítulo #7 del podcast de FITténtalo en el que hablaremos sobre… ¿Existen alimentos buenos y malos?


En la imagen os dejo una ecuación sencilla que pretende aunar los factores (principales) que influyen en la adecuación de un alimento:







Variables a controlar para saber si un alimento es bueno o malo:



Los ingredientes del alimento: ¿tiene ingredientes de calidad?, ¿es una materia prima?, ¿a qué proceso de manipulación ha sido sometido?
La composición en macro y micronutrientes: ¿es un alimento especialmente rico en algún nutriente?, ¿cuál es su densidad nutricional*?
La frecuencia de consumo/contexto: ¿cuántas veces al mes/año consumes ese alimento?, ¿se trata de una ocasión social especial?, ¿cuál es tu motivación para comer dicho alimento?
El sujeto que lo consuma: ¿haces deporte?, ¿tienes alguna patología metabólica?, ¿te encuentras en un porcentaje de grasa saludable?



*Densidad nutricional: cantidad de nutrientes / calorías


El paso siguiente a juzgar un alimento de forma aislada, sería juzgar solamente uno de sus componentes (ej. el azúcar, la sal, la grasa, al aceite de palma, etc.) y demonizarlo,  pero ese debate lo dejamos para otro día. Simplemente adelantaros que no entiendo eso de buscar culpables individuales de un problema que es claramente multifactorial.


Las cosas no son blancas o negras. Todo depende. Os lo dice una gallega.

Bonus: Trucos para no abandonar tus propósitos:






Coloca la tabla resumen en un lugar visible.
Pon alarmas a las horas que hayas establecido para hacer cada tarea.
Enfócate en los logros, no en los errores (recuerda que esto mejorará tu autoconfianza).
En momentos de flaqueza, recuerda por qué empezó todo. ¿Para qué querías conseguir ese objetivo?
Vigila tu entorno (y tus compañías). Si nuestro entorno no está alineado con nuestros propósitos, es mucho más complicado mantener el foco.
Reformula tus objetivos si es necesario. A lo largo de 12 meses pueden pasar muchas cosas, no tienes que esperar al año siguiente para rectificar.

Quizás te interese este otro episodio donde hablo de cómo vencer la procrastinación.





Mis mejores deseos para este nuevo año.





  Muy buenas a todos! Bienvenidos al primer preguntas y respuestas del podcast de FITténtalo. Hablaremos de…









Mi opinión sobre los probióticos de 3ª generación
¿Existe evidencia científica que demuestre que poner las piernas en alto mejora la recuperación?
¿Cómo evitar la procrastinación?
Mejores carbohidratos para deportistas












Utilidad de los probióticos de tercera generación:





Los mejores son los probióticos de 4ª generación. Dado que su uso no debería ser crónico, sino puntual (al menos eso es lo que nos dice la evidencia científica disponible hasta la fecha), merece la pena gastarse un poquito más de dinero.





Bonus: mejor si la cantidad de microorganismos sobrepasa las 1×10^9 UFC





¿Cómo evitar la procrastinación?






Ten claro tu objetivo y tu plan de acción: descríbelos de forma detallada. Este otro episodio quizás de ayude a ordenar un poco más tus ideas.
Corta de golpe con las distracciones.
Establece un momento concreto para hacer cada tarea (día y hora). Si quieres saber más sobre esto busca «Time blocking» en Internet.
Encuentra tu motivación: ¿para qué quieres hacer eso? ¿cuáles serán las consecuencias de no hacerlo?
Lo perfecto es enemigo de lo suficientemente bueno. ¡Empieza!
Divide tus tareas en tareas más pequeñas y que el primer paso sea súper fácil de realizar. Mas información buscando «Work Breakdown Structure» en Internet.






Hidratos de carbono para deportistas 






Arroz.
Cereales refinados: copos de maíz, por ejemplo.
Frutas desecadas: dátiles, pasas, higos secos, etc.
Miel.
Tubérculos: patata, boniato, yuca, etc. (llegados a cierto nivel, puede costar llegar a los requerimientos a base de este tipo de alimentos)






Bonus: al cocinar los tubérculos en el horno, pierden agua y puede ser más fácil llegar a consumir grandes cantidades.





¿Poner las piernas en alto mejora la recuperación?





Las estrategias para facilitar el retorno venoso pueden ser de utilidad. Los resultados todavía son mixtos, pero en el peor de los casos no harán nada (ni para bien ni para mal). Aquí os dejo algunos estudios sobre prendas de compresión (estudio, estudio).





No obstante, lo primero que hay que tener claro es si merece la pena acelerar el proceso de recuperación. La respuesta en muchos casos es: no.





Y hasta aquí este #5 episodio. Espero que lo disfrutéis tanto como yo he disfrutado grabándolo. Si es así, os agradezco infinitamente vuestras valoraciones de 5 estrellas en iTunes, vuestros me gusta y comentarios en iVoox y todo el feedback en general (me ayuda mucho).





Un abrazo y feliz semana!

¿Quieres hacer que tu dieta funcione?





Pues repite conmigo: seguir órdenes no funciona, seguir órdenes no funciona, seguir órdenes no funciona…





Quieres cambiar un hábito, pero no sabes por donde empezar. Voy a ir al grano: lo más importante para cambiar tu alimentación no es dar con la mejor dieta o contratar al mejor nutricionista. Lo más importante es asumir responsabilidades.





En el capítulo del podcast de hoy te cuento por qué esto es tan importante y cómo hacerlo.













Resumen de los primeros pasos para hacer que tu dieta funcione:






Define tu objetivo de forma detallada y concreta: ¿Qué quieres conseguir?
Detecta los obstáculos que te separan de tu objetivo: ¿Qué me está impidiendo alcanzar mi objetivo?
Separa esos obstáculos en dos grupos: los que están bajo tu control y los que no.
¿Realmente no puedes hacer nada para que las cosas que no están bajo tu control, empiecen a estarlo un poco más?












Aquí puedes descargar la plantilla guía para hacer los deberes de esta semana.





Cambiar un hábito es un proceso largo y costoso en el que la motivación viene y va. Nadie está motivado 27/7, ni debería estarlo. Lo que debe mantenerse es la responsabilidad y el compromiso con uno mismo.

FKU50,"We didn't bargain for this.But we're here to talk about it!With raw humor and help from friends and experts,we tackle the challenges and explore the secrets of aging well.It's all about...OUTSMARTING LIFE AFTER 50! On this bonus episode, meet the founders of Three Odd Guys brewing, a new brewery coming to Apopka, Florida. Listen in to hear the story behind the brand. In today’s episode, we had Dr. Jason Karp, an internationally recognized running coach, author, speaker, and founder of Run-Fit on the show to talk about the art of running. Karp fell in love with the sport of running in middle school and has been obsessed with the science behind peak athletic performance ever since. Listen in for tips and inspiration that will empower you to keep running well past the age of 50. After perhaps the most difficult year of his life, our guest Howard Snooks asked the Universe for a sign. Shortly after he read an article in the paper about the need for Baby Boomer representation in the modeling industry. He found an agent, locked down a gig and the rest is history. At the age of 65, Howard started his career in commercial modeling. Yes, you read that right. 5 years later he’s now a runway model and has starred in two indie films. If you’re looking for inspiration on navigating life’s curveballs and still coming out on top, you’ve come to the right place. Jay Jones decided to change his career path at 49 when he saw the importance of the plant-based movement to the health of people and the environment. He is now the Vice President of Sales for Heritage Health Food and manages the sale of Worthington Food products, a brand that’s offered tasty plant-based foods since 1945. Learn about the oldest plant-based option on the market on this episode of FKU50. When menopause started early for our guest, Rachel Lankester, she was devastated at first. Over time she came to view this period as a positive experience that inspired introspection and soul-searching in her life. Leaving an uninspiring career in the PR field, she now hosts The Magnificent Midlife, a podcast intended to empower women to live their midlife to the fullest. On today’s episode, she shares her experience with menopause and provides insights into how men can be more present and understanding with the women in their life as they navigate menopause together. We all have more junk in our garage than we’d like to admit. Wayne Clark, owner of Garage Living, came on the show to talk about his area of expertise: helping people turn their garage into a place that sparks joy instead of dread. If you need some motivation to clean your garage, this episode’s for you."

Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/four-pillar-fitness/support Youth sports, especially in the US, has taken a lot of criticism lately.

Not so much for the actual playing of the sports themselves. The criticism usually involves the behaviors, attitudes and actions of the adults involved.

Generally, it's always been thought that playing sports is good for kids.

Most people who've played youth sports would likely agree.

In today's episode, I review a study out of Montreal that links playing youth sports between 6 and 10 with better emotional health outcomes at age 12 and beyond.

Is this true? Can they back up their claims?

Listen in and get the low-down!

It can all add up to a serious post-holiday bulge!

But you can avoid it if you're prepared.

Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/four-pillar-fitness/support What's the key to success?

Is there really a ""secret sauce"" for long-term success and achievement?

What separates those who push through the hard times from those who bail when the going gets tough?

Angela Duckworth is the author of the book ""Grit"" and a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania.

In this episode, I take a look at a huge study done on the factors that predict success.

Ms. Duckworth and her colleagues looked at over 11,000 West Point cadets to see what personality traits separated the successful from the unsuccessful.

Give it a listen. I think you'll find it interesting!

Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/four-pillar-fitness/support Today, I'm going to share my thoughts on whether parents should hire a youth fitness coach for their kids.

Of course, since I am a Youth Fitness Professional, you might imagine that I'm biased toward a ""yes"" answer.

You might be surprised!

While I do believe that every kid would benefit from working with a Youth Fitness Pro, that doesn't mean it's the right choice for you, as a parent, or for your kid.

So I'm going to share a few insights that may help you make that decision.

Sean has resolved to lose 36 pounds by the end of July. How will he accomplish this feat? He has no clue. Though he's worked out throughout his entire life, focusing on dietary discipline and hitting the gym has been an issue. Set to turn 38, Sean wants to regain his mojo and focus on living as many high quality years as possible. If that means suffering through a few kale smoothies, then so be it.

This is a light hearted, realistic look at how to focus on health and acquire a positive balance with your other responsibilities and commitments."

FB: @functionised Body dysmorphic disorder describes a condition where a person can’t stop thinking about one or more perceived flaws with her appearance. The flaw can either be minor or one that is imagined. Seen from an outside perspective, the obsession with these flaws will seem unnecessary or baseless, but to the person, her appearance seems so shameful and distressing that in some cases she won’t want to be seen by anyone.

Welcome back to the Fundamentally FIT three-part series looking at Plant-Based diets. 
 
Back in Episode one, I was looking at some of the ethical and environmental more people are being tempted by this style of diet. I also look back on my experience of helping people make large scale lifestyle change and why this might be a challenge for the mainstream population. 
 
Here in Episode two, I am looking at the many different definitions and ways in which you could adopt a plant-based diet in 2020. I take a look at the number of people adopting these diets to see if they match the media attention. Finally, I also explore some of the key touchpoints you need to be aware of and research further if you are adopting one of the main plant-based diets.

We are kicking off the New Year with a brand new Podcast series looking more closely at the main factors surrounding the rise of plant-based diets.
In episode one, I ask the question is it realistic to expect the masses to adopt a plant-based diet for climate change reasons?

Andy EP 58: Marathon Race Week Advice.

With many of the big home and European marathons taking place over the next few weeks I thought it would be a good time to talk about your race week preparations. 

While the long runs are in the bag, your final week's preparations can have a significant impact on the big day. Overdo your hydration and risk muscle cramps, too many spicy foods and risk digestive upset, and the all too common problem of starting too fast. 

I cover all of this and much more in this Bonus episode of the Fundamentally FIT Podcast. 

Please share this podcast with a friend or family member you know who is running a big marathon in the next few weeks. 

Andy Strong - Endurance &amp; Nutrition Coach. 

Questions: Andy@fundamentallyfit.co.uk After a break from the Podcast, I am pleased to say we are back! 

This week I want to talk about the importance of spring when it comes to hitting your summer goals. With warmer weather, lighter evenings and renewed focus this is the most important 12 weeks of the year for hitting your summer goals. 

If you would me to cover a specific training, health or nutrition topic on the Podcast please leave a comment down below.

Professor Keith Baar is a leading researcher on the topic and joins this week's GAINcast to talk about how connective tissue works together with muscles and bones to produce movement.

They connect together on field and off field work. They connect strength and skill. The longer Calvin Morriss coaches, the more important this aspect of training is.

Folge des GANNIKUS Podcasts ist wieder eine mit interner Besetzung, was bedeutet, dass Marcel und ich uns in diesem Fall über aktuelle Themen und Ereignisse innerhalb und ausnahmsweise auch außerhalb der Fitness- und Bodybuilding-Szene unterhalten. Unter anderem geht es am Anfang nämlich zumindest kurz um den überraschend bei einem Helikopterabsturz verstorbenen Kobe Bryant, ein Idol unserer beider Kindheit und Jugend. Im weiteren Verlauf kommen dann Veranstaltungen wie die FIBO oder der World Fitness Day zur Sprache und Marcel erklärt euch, warum wir in diesem Jahr erneut keinen Stand auf der Messe in Köln haben werden. Darüber hinaus geben wir euch ein kleines Update zur Arnold Classic und behandeln die Idee von Max und Alex, einen Most Hated Cup auf die Beine zu stellen. Nicht vergessen: Bei 1000 Daumen nach oben aufs YouTube-Video haut Marcel die Insider-Story zur FIBO raus!Viel Spaß beim HörenEuer Danny Für die mittlerweile 44. Episode des GANNIKUS Podcasts habe ich mich mit Mike Sommerfeld zu einem Gespräch verabredet, das am Ende gute zwei Stunden gedauert hat. Jeder unserer Follower, der schon immer einmal wissen wollte, wie der ambitionierte Bodybuilder wirklich tickt sowie Erklärungen für seine Taten und Verhaltensweisen sucht, dürfte in diesem ausführlichen Gespräch die passenden und zugleich nachvollziehbaren Antworten finden. 

Wir hangeln uns Stück für Stück durch die verschiedenen Themenbereiche durch und behandeln unter anderem, wie es Mike noch in diesem Jahr zum Mr. Olympia schaffen möchte, wie sein Gendefekt und damit die Leberwerte dabei zu einem ständigen Problem werden, warum er nun lediglich vorübergehend in der Classic Physique gelandet ist und welche Körpergröße wirklich in seinem Ausweis stehen müsste. 

Ich wünsche euch viel Spaß beim Zuhören/Zusehen
Euer Danny In Deutschland zählt Adolf Burkhard zu den aufstrebendsten Schwergewichts-Bodybuildern überhaupt, insbesondere seitdem er sich im Rahmen der Dennis James Classic 2018 endlich die lang ersehnte Pro Card sicherte. Gemeinsam mit seiner Lebensgefährtin Viola Burk erlangte er damals in der Frankfurter Jahrhunderthalle den Profi-Status und hat nun nach einem ersten Reinschnuppern bei der George Farah Classic sein wirkliches Pro-Debüt in New York vor der Nase. 

Für die 43. Folge des GANNIKUS Podcasts habe ich mich mit Adolf über die gängigen Themen Training und Ernährung unterhalten sowie auch seine Wurzeln und Anfänge zum Schwerpunkt gemacht. Darüber hinaus sind wir in den zweieinhalb Stunden, die unser Gespräch letztlich dauerte, auch noch auf heiklere Storys der vergangenen Wochen zu sprechen gekommen, beispielsweise auf die RepOne-Debatte und seine Gastauftritte mit rund 140 Kilo Körpergewicht, die für Furore innerhalb der Szene sorgten. 

Ich wünsche euch viel Spaß beim Zuhören/Zusehen
Euer Danny Heute sind wir wieder in der allseits bekannten und internen Besetzung für euch am Start, um eine komplette Folge den inzwischen über ein Jahrzehnt lang erhältlichen Hardcore Boostern zu widmen. Stolze 95 Minuten teilen Marcel und ich unsere Erfahrungen mit den Pre-Workout-Produkten, denen der angestrebten Potenz wegen zum Teil nicht nur eine, sondern gleich mehrere Amphetamin-ähnliche Substanzen zugesetzt wurden. 

In der 42. Episode des GANNIKUS Podcasts thematisieren wir neben den Anfängen der Hardcore Boostern auch deren Ähnlichkeit zu gesetzlich reglementierten Betäubungsmitteln und nennen unter anderem unsere persönlichen All-Time-Favorites aus diesem Segment. Darüber hinaus erzählen wir von unseren krassesten Storys und geben ebenfalls einen Ausblick darüber, was die Zukunft für derartige Formeln bereithält. 

Ich wünsche euch viel Spaß beim Zuhören/Zusehen
Euer Danny Mit nur 21 Jahren mehr oder minder unerwartet zum IFBB Pro werden? Mein heutiger Gast Urs Kalecinski alias ""the.miraclebear"" kann genau das von sich behaupten. Im Rahmen der Iceland Open sicherte sich der Schwabe in der Classic Physique die heiß begehrte Pro Card und katapultierte sich damit auf den Radar der Bodybuilding-Welt. Wir widmen uns in dieser Folge einem turbulenten Jahr, das für ihn vor allem gegen Ende noch einmal deutlich an Fahrt aufnahm. Unter anderem spreche ich mit Urs in dieser Folge darüber, wie professionell aus seiner Sicht die Größenmessungen bei Wettkämpfen ablaufen und welche Ausnahme hier wohl die Dennis James Classic spielt. Darüber hinaus behandeln wir ebenso die gängigen Themen Training, Ernährung und Trainerwahl, die vom 21-Jährigen durchaus ein wenig anderes angegangen werden. Auch das Thema Stoff darf natürlich nicht fehlen, um eine Episode des GANNIKUS Podcasts abzurunden. Ich wünsche euch viel Spaß beim ZuhörenEuer Danny In der 40. Folge des GANNIKUS Podcasts ist Emir Omeragic zu Gast, mit dem ich wahrlich einen Tieftauchgang in die Welt des Wettkampf-Bodybuildings absolviere. Wir besprechen unter anderem seine Anfänge, sprich wie er mit erst 8 Jahren von Montenegro nach Deutschland kam, aber selbstverständlich auch den gegenwärtigen Zustand. Wie trainiert der 20-Jährige, was muss er vor allem unternehmen, um in einem so jungen Alter schon derart massiv zu sein, und würde er gesundheitliche Einschränkungen in Kauf nehmen, um einmal Mr. Olympia zu werden? Auf diese Fragen bekommt ihr Antworten!Gleichzeitig widmen Emir und ich uns aber auch den brisanten Themen der jüngeren Vergangenheit. So geht der PEAK-Athlet beispielsweise detaillierter darauf ein, wie er zum viral gegangenen Kritik-Video seines Freunds Erdem Dül steht und was er selbst von RepOne bzw. Matze Busse hält. Ebenso arbeiten wir noch einmal die Streitsache mit Matthias Botthof auf, der kürzlich auf der Deutschen Meisterschaft harte Worte für einige Nachwuchstalente gefunden hatte. Ich wünsche euch viel Spaß bei dieser EpisodeEuer Danny"
Garage Gym Athlete,"The Garage Gym Athlete Podcast was born from a community of underground athletes you've probably never heard of before. The idea for this show stemmed from Jerred Moon, the creator of Garage Gym Athlete programming, when he would do weekly coaching calls with Garage Gym Athletes. He found each athlete had such a unique story, an inspirational journey, and had overcome their own set of challenges that could help impact other athletes...but only if the stories could be told to all. The athletes all have a diverse background; some from Powerlifting, CrossFit, Olympic Lifting, Endurance Training, Military Operators, Collegiate Athletes, Spartan Racers, Obstacle Course Racers, and many other forms of physical training. It takes the experience of these athletes braving the extreme heat, bitter cold, early mornings, and late nights to tackle their training and become athletes. This podcast is for Garage Gym Athletes and by Garage Gym Athletes. Athletes share their experience (whether a beginner or advanced), share their knowledge, and give us a glimpse into the life of a Garage Gym Athlete!! We all know the gym SUCKS...And it comes with a long commute, crowds of people, occupied equipment, and much worse...Also, home fitness SUCKS...Because the treadmill becomes a clothing rack...Or you spend an hour with a DVD jumping around in your living room...But we're changing the game...By providing the other guy (who's strapped for time) with intelligent training to help them perform and look like an athlete. Our aim is for this podcast to inspire your own Garage Gym journey and to pick up as much as you can from other Garage Gym Athletes who are crushing it!! This weeks Ask Me Anything is about intermittent fasting. Some of us coaches and a lot our athletes already do IF, but we always get new athletes in wondering more about IF and how best to do it with their schedule, goals, etc.  Hey all, this weeks study we are talking about becoming more powerful. The study we go over looked at the effects of velocity metrics, lifting faster and how it can increase performance. Next we have our first book review! We do a deep nutrition dive, about Deep Nutrition, by Dr. Catherine Shanahan. This weeks workout is 1/4 mile for humanity.  This weeks snippet is why our training is not crossfit and should not be considered crossfit.  This weeks athlete of the week is Greg Isenhour. Greg has been up the podcast before and is still crushing it, doing crazy events and still living his best life. We talk about keeping up with events, him doing the Baton Death march again, and recovery.  This weeks Ask Me Anything are are talking about having goals that may seem conflicting and talking about how to pursue goals that may seem conflicting. A lot of people think you can only do on thing at a time and only focus on one area but that is not sure, that is why we do whats called concurrent training. But Jerred dives more into this topic and the science behind it. Hey athletes, this week for our study we are slightly stray away from the actual study but for good reason. We will be talking about gaining muscle even when in a caloric deficit and what you really need to build muscle. Also why the ""if it fits my macros"" approach doesnt really work. This weeks topic we share our tips and practices on downregulation. This weeks workout is Sallys Revents. "

 Are past traumas leading you down a path of self-sabotage? Unprocessed negative experiences become stored in your body as emotional blockages that can prevent you from aligning with your true self. Tim Coleman is a former personal trainer who is dedicated to liberating people from the physical manifestations of their negative energy. As a therapist, health coach, and EFT practitioner, Tim helps his clients get to the root cause of their stress, finally process their trauma, and overcome the ailments that have developed as a result of emotional clutter. Today he breaks down EFT and trauma processing so that you can apply the same principles in your own life. He and Nimai discuss how you can locate and relieve your own blockages, understand your real desires, and finally get out of a cycle of triggers. Tim also explains how your diet plays a pivotal role in what’s stored in your body and why the energy you broadcast is imperative to living a happy, healthy life. You’ll hear the strategies and techniques he applies to clients that help them overcome addiction, eliminate phobias, and finally live according to who they are -- in spite of their past. 
  
 “What you’re doing is eliminating those triggers, because the triggers are what’s going to hold you back. The past emotional experiences are going to create self-sabotage.”
 -Tim Coleman

Gesund und Fit,"Es geht um die Themen gesund und fit zu sein. Dort erzähle ich über die Ernährungsweise des cleaneating (mein Blogthema) und führe Interviews mit Fitnesstrainern aus Studios, Besitzern gesunder Restaurants, einer angewandten Neurowissenschaftstrainerin, mit Gründern der Herstellerfirmen von Fitnessprodukten. Hallöchen und willkommen zu einer neuen Folge von Gesund und Fit.
Das Interview findet mit meiner lieben Pilatestrainerin Angela statt. Sie steht mir Rede und Antwort rund um das Thema Pilates.
Hier geht es heute um rückengerechtes und fasziales Pilates. Worte wie Powerhouse erwarten Dich hier nicht, denn da geht es nicht drum.
Gehört Achtsamkeit dazu? Sei gespannt.
Welchen Krankheiten kann man vorbeugen und kann man es trotz etwaiger Einschränkungen in der Gesundheit ausüben?
Wie ist es mit der Ausatmung? Findet sie passiv statt oder wie funktioniert es?
Die Kontrolle über einzelne Bereiche des Körpers ist ein weiterer Aspekt sowie eine stabilisierende Anspannung.
Ganz viel Spaß bei Folge und melde Dich gerne für Feedback bei mir.
Deine Yasmin Es geht hier um eine bemerkenswerte Abnehmreise meiner Freundin Steffi. Sie hat es geschafft ganze 30 kg abzunehmen. Wie sie das geschafft hat siehst Du teilweise anhand von den Bildern hier unter der Folge. Die Bilder entsprechen dem Stand eines aktuellen Trainingsplans den sie sich auf einer magnetischen großen Tafel anlegt und alle paar Wochen erneuert. Das ist eine großartige Idee, so kann sie an jedem Tag die einzelnen Übungen abhaken und hat ein gutes Gefühl dabei. Es wird einem aber auch nie langweilig weil man eine gewisse Art der Vielfalt rein bringen kann. Seid ganz gespannt und hört gerne in die Folge rein."
Gesunde Häppchen,"In einer Welt voller Ernährungsirrtümer und Abnehmversprechungen, brauchst du regelmäßige Impulse und Anregungen, um deinen Lebenswandel mit der Natur und deinem Körper in Einklang zu bringen. Hör' endlich auf mit Diäten und Kalorien zählen. In diesem Mini-Podcast steht die evolutionäre Gesundheit im Mittelpunkt, also das Wissen über die ursprüngliche und artgerechte Ernährung unserer Vorfahren. Inspiriert durch das jahrtausendealte Wissen der Jäger und Sammler Gesellschaften auf unserem wunderbaren Planeten. Gesunde Häppchen liefert dir regelmäßige Informationen und Inspirationen rund um einen ganzheitlichen Lebenswandel. Dabei liegt die Würze in der Kürze und liefert dir mit jeder neuen Folge eine extra Portion Gesundheit. Man soll immer aufhören, wenn es am schönsten ist. Daher möchte ich dir in dieser Infofolge erzählen, wie es mit dem Gesunde Häppchen Podcast weiter geht. Natürliche Entgiftung fängt zuhause an und ist kein Hexenwerk. Ich möchte dir meine persönlichen Favoriten vorstellen und erklären worauf du achten musst. Eine natürliche Entgiftung umfasst 3 unterschiedliche Phasen, die unmittelbar nacheinander ablaufen und damit dabei keine Schäden entstehen. Heute erfährst du, welche natürlichen Prozesse der Entgiftung tagtäglich in unserem Körper ablaufen und welche Organe dabei wichtig sind. Giftstoffe belasten unsere Gesundheit und machen uns langfristig chronisch krank, auch wenn die Schulmedizin das ganz vehement abstreitet. Colostrum ist ein wahrer Immunbooster und kann dir helfen allerlei unterschiedliche Probleme zu bekämpfen und die solltest du kennen."

Get Off Our Lawn - CF Masters,"The official podcast of the CF Masters Facebook group. A Crossfit Masters podcast, focused on the topics that concern your average over-35 crossfitter who is juggling a career, family, age, and a myriad of other things in addition to fitness.On the high end the conversations can be about how to get to or even win the Games in your Age Group. It can be about how you juggled all of the above and still hit CF every day that you can. We're here to listen to people with great stories. Have you ever had a conversation with someone where, going in, you kind of figured what you would be talking about then you start listening and realize how much more you can learn about someone? Yeah, that's what happened.

This week we get to talk to Janice Hurley. Janice is a long time member of CF Masters. I knew she had written a book about dental image branding and runs the Crossfit Masters 60+ group, but holy crap she's so much more. She's an in-demand keynote speaker, a management consultant, a doting grandmother - who raised 4 kids on her own,  and she's pretty damn good with a camera. Just ask the Masters who hit the Legends comp last year. By the way, she didn't start the paid speaker gig until she was 50 which is a great reminder that it's never to late to pick up a skill and master it.

I've been remiss as hell at getting this episode posted. The holidays, unemployment, and a myriad of other excuses come to mind - none of them any good. On a good note, I got to listen to this episode several times which was awesome because I needed to hear someone as excited about life as Janice is.

Hope you enjoy the episode.

Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/cf-masters/message Welcome back to Get Off Our Lawn! The podcast for Crossfit Masters.

This week, we are going deep into the holidays.

No, we did not do a holiday gift guide.

Just go buy some chalk. You can always use more chalk.

We did get a chance to talk about holiday nutrition with Gwen Holtan, long time member of CF Masters and co-founder of Beyond the Box Nutrition. Who better to ask about surviving the holidays with all of the inherent temptation than a nutrition coach?

You know there will be cookies in the office and holiday parties and food, food and more food. What are some strategies for making it successfully through this maze of temptation and into a healthy new year?

Gwen shares her insights.

We also go into why she started Beyond the Box Nutrition, how her previous corporate life managing and mentoring a team of over 10 sales reps aligns with nutrition coaching, and, at the very end, she shares a pretty badass snippet of what makes her tick. How, at 13, she had to play on an all-boys soccer team because the city her family moved to didn’t have elite girls soccer, and she was determined to play.

One thing about CF Masters is that we have an amazing group of totally badass women.

It was great talking to Gwen, and I really hope you enjoy this episode. If it helps you make it through even one holiday party then we have done our job!

If you want to get hold of Gwen, you can find her at beyondtheboxnutrition.com or on instagram @beyondtheboxnutrition

If you like your content please click 5 stars and share with a friend. I’m guessing there are more than a few folks looking to get through the holidays unscathed.

If you want to hear a specific topic, leave a comment and we’ll try and make it happen.

Thanks. Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year!

Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/cf-masters/message Welcome back to Get Off Our Lawn!!! In this episode, episode 11, we talk to Doctor Sean Rocket, the OG of crossfit Orthopedic surgeons. Angela and I get to ask him a wide range of questions about medicine and crossfit and motivation and how crossfit and nutrition has infiltrated his medical practice. Sean is a great person to talk to, and we really hope that you enjoy this episode.

Look, we all know that Crossfit is no more dangerous or injury causing than any other sport, but sometimes we get hurt, maybe we aggravate old injuries, or, we get a new injury. When that happens, the first thing we do is… ask the CF Masters facebook group to diagnose it for us and then suggest treatment.

Then we go to 321gomd.com to read an article about our injury written by a real doctor.

Sean Rockett is the real doctor behind 321gomd.com

He’s also an orthopedic surgeon. He’s been a crossfitter since before Ben Bergeron opened Crossfit New England, and Sean really, really cares about making people better.

I’ve listened to several podcasts with Sean, and the one thing that I was always interested in is “why?”

Why are you an orthopedic surgeon? Instead of being say an oncologist or a family medicine doc. How did you choose the path to orthopedics specifically?

OK, I’ll be totally honest. One of the things that fascinates me more than anything about everyone is - why are you who you are? How did you get here and what choices did you make along the way?

Thankfully, Sean shared his story with us and his desire to help people started at a young age. Thanks, in large part, to the influence of his parents who were both surgeons.

Early on when we started Get Off Our Lawn, Angela wanted to get Sean as a guest. She made it happen, and you get the benefit.

When it comes to interesting episodes this one absolutely takes the cake.

The only problem, and this is probably due to my WiFi - we lost the recording of when Sean beat Ben Bergeron in a WOD.

We could call up Sean and re-record that segment, but I think it would be much more interesting to send a camera out and record it live.

Enjoy!

Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/cf-masters/message This was a really fun conversation. Allison is an old school crossfitter, competitive personality, and cool AF person to talk to. She started NorCal Masters comp with her husband TJ (of TJ's gym) in order to compete against, well, other masters age athletes. Then she turned her attention to running the competition and did so for many years.

This episode is by special request, because NorCal Masters has meant a LOT to the masters community over the years. It was one of the first, and definitely preeminent masters crossfit competitions. It was accessible to anyone, but the programming was not at all reduced for masters - you had to earn it. A lot of people flew in from all over not only to compete but often to volunteer. NorCal Masters has opened the door for other folks to know that a masters focussed competition is not only possible but can be well attended.

Sadly, the competition is not going to happen in 2020, but Allison and TJ are open to bringing it back. The amount of effort they put in over the years to make it happen is crazy, and they would need some help to get the comp going again. Listen to the episode for some ideas that Allison has.

I judged at NorCal Masters one year, and Allison taught me something very important. It was an ascending rep heavy thruster/burpee workout, and Allison was extremely clear, ""You can NOT jerk the thrusters."" A person I was judging was having a really hard time with the weight, was in no position to be competitive, and I was allowing them to ..... jerk the thrusters. Allison walked up behind me and simply said, ""the standard is the standard."" And she was right. The standard is the standard. Do....the....work....

I also snuck in a question about high school kids applying to college - because she knows a lot about that, and I have a couple of 9th graders. Ya get to do that when you're doing the interview.

If you need to contact Allison, she can be reached at allison@tjsgym.com

I hope you enjoy. If you like us give us a 5-star review. If you have comments or suggestions for future episodes, don't hesitate to leave a comment either here or in the CF Masters group on Facebook.

and here's Allison.....

Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/cf-masters/message In the CF Masters group on Facebook, we talk a lot about how the youngsters don't understand us old folks. It's true, they don't, but they can coach us.

I pulled in my coach, Cheryl Hargrove to talk about what it means for someone under 30 to coach old people, we talk about how her dad went from struggling with mobility at 67 to watching his placing on the Open leaderboard, and we talk a little bit about mindset and training and nutrition. 

If you want to find Cheryl, you can reach her on Instagram @cherylfasho, and she also programs for Outside the Box (outsidethebox.fit) which is online programming for the backyard, park, garage, and home gym — anytime, anywhere. They make sure you’re in and out in 30 minutes, and that includes a warm-up.

Enjoy this conversation. Yes, kids can coach us and do so quite well. Though they will hear us complain regularly.....

Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/cf-masters/message Welcome to Episode 7 of Get off our lawn, the CF Masters group podcast.

This week we have a very, very, very important topic and we have a couple of great friends and members of the group joining us. We’re talking about Mental Health.

You might ask - What does that have to do with Crossfit?

And that’s a great question because, for a lot of folks, mental health has nothing to do with Crossfit. For a few of us, however, Crossfit is a part of the puzzle that keeps us healthy both mentally and physically.

This week, Angela and I were incredibly lucky to have a couple of great guests. Josh Inman and Debra Gordon.

Josh recently started CF Masters Strong group on Facebook. This group is a forum where people can share their challenges with mental health, maybe see some folks in similar situations, and just have an area to know that we are not alone.

We also have Debra Gordon, a long time member of CF Masters. Debra reached out a month or so ago to ask if we could do a Get Off Our Lawn episode on mental health and depression.

Debra has lived with depression for decades and wanted to share her story, and how Crossfit has helped her.

To be honest, it wasn’t clear if we should cover this topic because it’s very, very serious for people, and we wanted to do it justice. We hope that we did.

First off, the reason we are doing this episode is to help, even in a miniscule way, to chip away at the stigma of mental health.

If you are in the United States, and you or a person close to you needs help or needs to talk about suicide, Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at  1-800-273-8255

If you are not in the United States, and many of our listeners are not, please look for your local suicide prevention service.

Maybe a few of us grew up differently, but most of us in our age group grew up in an era where mental health was shunned, shamed, and pushed into a corner. People who were depressed needed to “suck it up” and “get over it.”

Sure, we never told a cancer patient, “it’s your fault you know. If you had taken better care of yourself you wouldn’t have gotten breast cancer.” But we did tend to think that about people with mental health issues.

Now it’s time to change that. Mental Health IS health.

Also - NOTHING in this episode is prescriptive. Josh and Debra are here to share their experiences, where they are today, and what got them here. These are their stories as they have lived them. None of this information is meant to be used as treatment or therapy.

If you have mental health issues PLEASE seek out a trained professional. If you are thinking about self-harm please call a Suicide prevention hotline.

We are here today to share that everyone can be susceptible to mental health issues just like everyone can be susceptible to being in a car crash or getting a sinus infection.

Also, please note that we are talking as friends here. We are not mental health professionals, we don’t know all the right terms, and we might say the wrong thing. Please understand that everything we talk about is said from a good place. If we mislabel a condition, or if we use a word that is no longer acceptable - we are old and set in our ways - while we are also learning. Let us know in the comments any place where we should have used different words.

For the podcast. Please share this with anyone or any group you think may be interested.

Also, please Like and give us a 5-star review on your podcast app. And don’t forget - Mental Health IS health.

Gluten Free Weigh In,"Eating gluten free and trying to lose weight or just manage weight is a challenge.  Sue Jennett, and her co-hosts are all on different weight loss/management journeys with one thing in common - they are all committed to a gluten free diet.  Join the conversation weekly to catch up with the successes and challenges faced by each of the co-hosts taking a different path to control their weight. This week I speak with Tamie and Sara.  Tamie has decided on a fitness challenge, which became so much more real, when she said it out loud on the podcast.  Sara had plans to begin an exercise regime in January, but they were sidelined.  She is struggling to pivot her plans.  To find more information about the gluten free oats I mentioned go to their website at www.myonlyoats.com

Folge direkt herunterladen Wie kannst Du durch die richtige Atmung leichter Laufen? Das ist eine der großen Fragen, die bei der Lauftechnik viel zu oft unter den Tisch fällt. Denn das Atmen fällt vielen Läufer*innen schwer. Und oftmals sind sie sich dessen nicht einmal bewusst!Melina Pätzold hat in Rostock und Wien Klarinette studiert und lebt nun als freischaffende Musikerin in Berlin. Mit ihrem Ensemble SONeO und verschiedenen Orchestern gibt sie dort Konzerte und unterrichtet. Ihr Ausgleich zum stressigen Musiker*innen-Alltag stellt das Laufen dar. Mithilfe des Laufens baut sie Stress ab, es löst den Knoten im Kopf und trainiert natürlich auch ihre Kondition für anstrengende Konzerte.Doch das war nicht immer so. Nach einer Sehnenscheidenentzündung im ersten Studiensemester, stellte sie ihr Studium komplett in Frage, begann zu laufen und sich mehr mit den Themen Atmung, Achtsamkeit und dem Körper im Allgemeinen zu beschäftigen. Erst durch die ""richtige"" Atmung fand sie dann für sich den Spaß am Laufen und konnte die ewige Kurzatmigkeit abstreifen. Wie Dir das auch gelingen kann, was die ""richtige"" Atmung ist und was Dein Bauch damit zu tun hat, das erfährst Du im Interview mit ihr. Außerdem wartet ein toller Selbsttest, mit dem Du erfährst, ob Du mehr in den Brustraum oder den Bauch atmest.

Going 567,"In a noisy world saturated with podcasts that regurgitate the same information over and over, it can be difficult to separate the useful from the useless.Going 567 is here to fix that. Coaches and Authors Paul Reddick and Ryan Munsey bring you real, unscripted weekly conversations where we discuss tested tactics we use in our own lives and the lives of those we coach.Each episode is packed with insight after insight, not the same regurgitated information, bringing you actionable strategies to move from the head to the heart and create the life you desire. Erica is the owner of Dub Fitness and we dive into her life story thus far, her experiences in the military, what war is like, her business, and much more The guys discuss Paul's new Heartbeats Tour, the importance of gaining a better understanding of who you are, seeking the governing dynamics that underlie any system, the worst question we've ever been asked, a powerful filtering system to make you a better communicator, and a valuable lesson from the 23-Funnel. The guys kick off 2020 by covering ""holiday purgatory"", entrepreneurs and control, Ricky Gervais putting Hollywood on blast, updates on Ryan's trip to New York, lessons from Jerry Seinfeld, an update on the book project, and the importance of figuring out the ONE thing you do. Paul &amp; Ryan discuss The Artist's Journey, the creative process and lifestyle design, the books that have impacted them the most, and some important lessons on unconditional love and parent-child agreements. Fresh off his trip to Austin, TX Paul breaks down his experience at Franklin BBQ and the guys talk about lessons from Aaron Franklin as well as the importance of where, when and how we approach the work that we all do. The conversation goes into how we can generate clarity in our actions, increase our focus, and drive improvements in quality, revenue, and peace of mind. The guys break down Paul's recent experience at  Peter Luger's world-famous steakhouse, handling criticism, managing interference from outside voices &amp; opinions, how to unapologetically own your schedule (without guilt), the power of the question ""To what end?"", and how direct experience is the original art - everything else is just advertising."

GOLDTOGREEN PODCAST,"GOLDTOGREEN is your online destination for health, wellness, running and style! In the seventh episode of the podcast, I sit down with stylist and fashion designer Carolyn Son.
We speak about her cultural background, being Cambodian and Vietnamese, her relationship to fashion, how it started and how it has evolved, from law and business to styling and design. With her brand C A R Ø, she conveys both worlds she grew up in — between the U.S. and South East Asia. Her upbringing was also heavily influenced by her parents, her father for example was a buddhist monk who escaped the refugee camps and still follows a diligent meditation practice today. Carolyn shares how she practices meditation in her daily New York life and how much she appreciated having powerful women surround her journey.
One of my favourite quotes from this episode:
When me and my brother turned 18, we were sent to a meditation retreat in the mountains.. you’re in complete silence for 10 days and it’s a type of meditation called Vipassana where you focus on your breath and you focus inwards, because so much of your life is outwards. You’re learning how to observe your emotions and project and visualise and manifest things in your life, all through meditation and self care first. I grew up in a very meditation heavy household and wanted to create a brand that also projects abundance all around you paying homage to my parents.

Huyen In the sixth episode of the podcast, I sit down with dear friend and co-captain of our running team WAYV RUN KOLLEKTIV: Daniel Marin Medina. 
I know it’s been long overdue, but here it is finally! Thanks to my media science institute at my university, we were able to record this special episode. We speak about how Daniel first came out, what it means to be a queer person of color, his upbringing in Colombia, Chicago and New York, his art and drawings, papayas, our favourite netflix show POSE, his move to Berlin, dancing, depression and duh.. running.. from XC to Nike Run Club to international marathons.
One of my favourite quotes from this episode:
There is this saying in Columbia which translates to ‘Don’t give papaya’ — it means if you give people room to mess with you, and they mess with you, that’s your fault, you gave them the room, so I just took this approach of don’t let them mess with you, don’t give them room. No Papayas for anyone. You had to pay for your papayas. I was brown, I was an immigrant, I was gay, I was tiny, there were a lot of things people could have messed with me for. I was like: no. Not going to happen. I was the first Out captain in our XC team and it was really nice to not pretend to be someone else.

            This picture was taken in Berlin in July 2019. In the fifth episode of the podcast, I sit down with Patty Dukes and Reph Star from CIRCA95.
We talk about their family history and upbringing in New York, marathon running and running crews, culture, hiphop, Bob Marley, their work with schools and the community, the Boston Marathon, and so much more. 
One of my favourite quotes from this episode:
‘It’s like when you give back and it comes back to you, that’s just amazing. At the end of the day, (the music, the art, the running) it’s not for us, it’s for the community, the more people open up and start their own projects, the more we see the love that we started… that seed is growing and that seed is going to other places, it’s never been about us, it’s never been about money, it’s about the people, its about love, ’ — Patty

            This picture was taken inside Canal Street Radio in April 2019. In the fourth episode of the podcast, I sit down with Jess Hu aka Jess2Sick.
We talk about her dance journey, her love for the community, the idea behind PROJECT SHMOOD, as well as her mental health practice and what it means to her to be an Asian female creative in today’s social media age. 
One of my favourite quotes from this episode:
‘Every day, I have to continue on being a creative, and being Asian, being female, being in dance, and heavy in the battle scene, being the only female in that scene, the pressure of not looking too feminine. (…) We [as Asian women] have to overcome all of these stereotypes. Being submissive is one of them. For a while, I fell into being submissive and let people walk all over me. Finally, it was dancing, it was moving to New York, finding myself, being solution-oriented that I realised, I know my worth now, but knowing your worth also means that you have to not let your culture, or your family, or other people hold you back. (…) When I look at it, I am thinking: I am the next wave, I am just this random string that is there to support and be vocal for people who felt silenced. I never in my life thought I wanted to be so vocal about being Asian-American, having a platform and being a role model, until I moved to New York. I realised, there are so many of us, but our side never gets told properly.’

            Here you see Jess in New York. We recorded this episode in late April 2019. In the third episode of the podcast, we sit down with Stephanie Tran.
We talk about her running journey, how she founded @thenewjock together with Aimee Cho, her involvement with Bridgerunners back in the day, and her upbringing as a Vietnamese woman in New York City. 
One of my favourite quotes from this episode when I asked her about Bridge The Gap:
“It’s bringing all the running community and all of these people together internationally and really celebrating diversity, culture, movement and I think it is eye opening and also it’s really wonderful because when you feel like you have this bond with all these people just through running, you let your guard down and there is less judgement, and it just helps you understand, that there is so much more to people than like appearances and I think that is what it does—it’s beautiful.”

            Here you see Stephanie inside the audio studio at Canal Street Market. We recorded this episode in early September 2018. In the second episode of the podcast, we sit down with Bee Walker. 
We talk about her fascination for the people in New York, how she started as a photographer, her transition from a 9 to 5 job to a more creative path, how she said ‘Yes’ to life, how running influences her life (including quotes from Eliud Kipchoge, the men’s world record holder in the marathon), her adventure with Paper Monday and some encouraging words on how you can start the thing you always dreamed about doing.
One of my favorite quotes from the podcast:
“Just do the thing, whatever you have in your heart, and don’t be concerned about it being perfect and don’t worry about what you don’t have, but you have something in your heart and that is real, that has its own momentum, and I truly believe, that its bigger than us. We’re sort of vessels for ideas, and concepts, and change, and so the thing in your heart, of course it’s going to feel huge, and probably intimidating, but it wouldn’t be put there, if you weren’t the person to bring it out. So just do it. Like… I started taking pictures on my iPhone (…) nobody makes fun of children when they learn how to walk. Why should it be any different. If a child I can accomplish so much, learning how to walk and talk in two years, all those things from scratch — like what can I do in two years. Where can I be two years from now: so just start.”

Gospel Centered Health,"Join Gospel Centered Health weekly to learn tips for living a fit life that brings honor to Jesus. For too long we have allowed the world to tell us what healthy living looks like.  It has nothing to do with vanity, but everything to do with loving others like Jesus. We take a Christ-centered approach to nutrition, emotional health, exercise, self-care, prayer, and lifestyle. Join Mendy as she interviews Andy Forbeck, a counseling graduate student and mens's ministry leader. Andy shares the definition of self-care. He profoundly explains the difference between relief and restoration. He urges Christians to allow their self-care to bring them closer to Jesus instead of themselves and the world around them.  Mendy defines self-compassion. What is it. What is it not? Then she takes a deep dive into how Christians should be practicing self-compassion in a Christ-centered way. We should be leading the charge on self compassion because Jesus is the creator of compassion and love. Just like He gives us forgiveness, grace, and love, we can also allow for compassion to settle in while we worship at His feet. Shellie Tomlinson, the author of several Christian books, shares how she strives to practice good portion control with her favorite southern cuisine. She is a radio host, is a grandmother, and regularly speaks at women's retreat and Christian conventions. Her joyful attitude and living a healthy life for Jesus is contagious. Grab these portion control tips and use them for you own life.  Mendy interviews Lana Stenner, the author of a 60-second devotional for parents and teens to do together before school starts. Lana shares how to create a shield around your home that creates a sacred and safe place for your teenagers to engage in short meaningful conversations. Lana also tells you how teens actually do want to discuss the hard topics, hear God's scripture spoken over them, and get a gentle hug each morning before heading out to the war zone known as high school.  Ashley Christian, an adoption advocate who intentionally eats to regulate her emotions and hormones, shares her favorite tips for success. She even shares her favorite healthy pizza recipe. Hear her story and be inspired to take flour, sugar, and alcohol from your diet. You'll also be motivated to try Kombucha. Ashley is relatable and sincere. Her real life journey will help you feel understood and normal.  Mendy shares why yoga is not congruent with the teachings found in God's word about meditation. She also points out how deeply rooted yoga is in the the Hindu religion and culture. Then, she shares her own journey practicing yoga but eventually feeling a strong conviction to stop. "
Graced Health,"For the woman who wants simple ways to take care of herself and age her body well. And of course, we enjoy a little chocolate in the process. I’m here to equip you with resources, hacks, and most importantly, grace for your health. We'll discover ways to integrate this into the gym and kitchen, and dig into the Word to see what we can learn from our Creator about our health. (And by the way, there's no BMI index in the Bible, so leave your body image concerns at the door!) ""Listen to your body"" ...  but what does that mean? Today we explore 12 ways your body may be talking to you. Try these simple protein-filled make-ahead breakfasts to get you and your child ready for the day.

Corrections: John McCain not Joe Biden stated that the UFC was like human cockfighting. 
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., saw a UFC tape. McCain, a lifelong boxing fan, was horrified at the ground fighting, kicks, and head butts. It was “barbaric,” he said. It was “not a sport.” He sent letters to all 50 governors asking them to ban ultimate fighting. The outcry against “human cockfighting” became a crusade, and like many crusades, it was founded on misunderstanding.

Greg McDermott Podcast,"A Podcast for people who are looking to listen to inspiring stories from others taking action, working towards and achieving goals in their own lives. Whether its in health and fitness, business or life in general Greg aims to share with you their stories so you to can be inspired through action. Enjoy In this episode I talk with one of the most remarkable guys I have ever had the pleasure of meeting, Craig Percival.

Craig has just completed something that has never been even attempted before let alone completed. He has completed 8 full distance Ironman Triathlons, in the 8 states/territories of Australia in 8 days. WOW. My head still shakes even thinking about this undertaking.

He has completed well over 20 Ironman Triathlons and has competed at the Ironman World Championships on 4 occasions. He has completed Ultraman Canada, qualified for and finished a remarkable second at the Ultraman World Championships in Hawaii.

Craig's message is simple and along the lines of a great sporting brand you may have heard of......JUST DO IT. Get up and get through the first 10 minutes of the training session, the race or even just the day and the rest will make itself happen. His other key message to take away from our conversation is to find YOUR WHY??

His drive and determination to inspire others to achieve their goals can be seen in the flesh with his very own coaching business, www.nolimitsendurance.com.au. Craig's support and care for his athletes is second to none and the results his athletes achieve speak for themselves. If you are looking for an amazing coaching experience to elevate you to the next level get in contact with him.

Throughout the 8in8in8 he raised well over A$80,000  for the John Maclean Foundation, an awesome organisation that aims to make the lives of young Australians who use wheelchairs. John himself came out and supported the event right through and I was honoured to be able to have a chat with him and the amazing work he does with young Australians. www.jmf.com.au

Keep going forward and
Keep kicking goals Welcome to 2016. This year will be the most successful year of your life to date. Take some time to set some big goals for yourself that you know will make you grow into a better, happier and more fulfilled person!! This week I sat down with and amazing young guy who through circumstances out of his control found himself in his young 20's having to stop and re-assess in which direction wanted his life to go. Lincolne has a passion for learning and growing like I've never before seen in someone of his age and I thoroughly enjoyed sitting down and talking with him about his past, how he tackles everyday and I think most importantly what he plans to do in the future. Please send him an email and let him know your thoughts on the episode. lincolneinnis@gmail.com Until next week Keep moving Keep going forward and Keep kicking goals. This week I had the pleasure of catching up with Andrew ""Reidy"" Reid. 

I've been following Reidy's amazing journey for a while now on Instagram and Facebook and after he cracked his 3 hour for the marathon for the first time he was true to his promise of coming on and having a chat.

Reidy's story will sound familiar to a few others we've heard with losing a stack of weight and finding who he truly is through competing in endurance sports and following his dreams. Reidy is the perfect example for someone living with a purpose. He gets up everyday with a passion for what he is doing and has a crack. He now runs his own event, The Bondi Splash 'n' Dash, works in radio for 2GB in Sydney, works with the Lifeguards at Bondi and is a star on the hit TV series Bondi Rescue which is about to start filming its 11th season in Australia.

He doesn't take himself too seriously which I think is awesome and that comes across really quickly.

If you want to follow Reidy he's on twitter at @reidy__ and on Instagram @reidy__

I hope you enjoy this one. Its a cracking conversation that we had on a sunny summer morning in Sydney before I dropped down to Bondi for a swim myself.

Until next week

Keep going Forward and
Keep kicking goals I sat down with Tim Ford for a chat around all things triathlon, weight loss, healthy lifestyle, goals and the future.

Tim's journey has many similarities with myself and I am totally inspired by what he is achieving in the sport. The quote on his webpage sums Tim up best I think, My Extraordinary, Ordinary Life. He just gets about chasing his goals and along the way inspires others to get up and have a go at a goal they have in mind. He now coaches athletes towards their goals along with studying law full time and travelling up to Thailand to his second home of Thanyapura as often as he can. www.thanyapura.com.

You can contact and follow Tim on Instagram @tford14 and please follow his blog at his website www.oztriathlete.com. There's some awesome articles up there particularly for those at the beginning of their triathlon, running or multisport journey.

Remember Temple Nutrition? These are the guys I am working with to help me to my goal of completing the 2016 Ultraman Australia Championships. Check them out at www.templenutrition.com.au and pop in the code 'mcdermott10' at the checkout for a 10% discount of your order.

Please keep sharing with your friends and if you have any ideas for shows, blogs, feedback or complaints please email me at greg@zeal2u.com.au.

Until next week
Keep moving
Keep going forward and 
Keep kicking goals This week I had the absolute privilege of chatting with Luke Tyburski. Luke's whole view on life and his amazing adventures could mean I could honestly talk with him for days on each of his individual adventures.

We focus on his story of the Ultimate Triathlon that he recently completed and also touch on some of his other amazing achievements including the Marathon Des Sables, his first ever triathlon The Double Brutal Extreme Triathlon (yes this was his first ever triathlon) and his experience learning to surf by riding 400kms to reach the coast before learning to surf the very next morning.

Like many of us Luke hasn't always this motivated, goal driven and generally happy. If you're in a bit of a spot right now where you're not totally happy then I'm sure Luke's story will help you to grow and overcome your struggles.

Luke's Hula Hoop theory is one we can all take something from. Throw it where you can't see it anymore, find it and move yourself back into the middle again. The further you throw it the bigger the adventure.

You can find Luke at www.luketyburski.com and he would love to hear your feedback.

Until next week
Keeping moving
Keep going forward and
Keep kicking goals This week I had the pleasure of sitting down with Annie Crawford. Annie is the chair and founder of Can Too Australia, an organisation formed to help regular people achieve some seriously big goals and also fund the research of cancer.

Annie lost her father to bowl cancer at the young age of 51 and she set out on a course to help fund the research of the disease along with inspiring others that the impossible is indeed possible. The organisation was born and has now trained over 11,000 people to achieve their goals and raised of A$16m for cancer research. It's remarkable that the organisation has achieved this is such a short space of time and I believe this is simply due to the drive and passion of Annie.

This is a wonderful chat about Can Too, the goals for the future along with Annie's personal achievements in both running and swimming.

You can find Can Too at www.cantoo.org.au and please have a good look at their program options if indeed you're looking at a running,swimming or triathlon event that's coming up. The program is FREE. thats right, FREE. All you need to do is get a few mates on board to sponsor you for some fundraising and you're away.

Temple Nutrition are still running their offer for all of our listeners of a 10% discount. www.templenutrition.com.au and enter the code ""mcdermott10"" at the checkout.
I've had a great week of extensively using their products and without solid food on a 6 hour ride I felt full of energy when finishing. I even remarked that I could've done another couple of hours on the bike i felt that good. Check them out.

Until next week

SB Khoo FRACGP, Penang Medical College.
Academic mobbing is a non-violent, sophisticated, ‘ganging up’ behavior adopted by academicians to “wear and tear” a colleague down emotionally through unjustified accusation, humiliation, general harassment and emotional abuse. These are directed at the target under a veil of lies and justifications so that they are “hidden” to others and difficult to prove. Bullies use mobbing activities to hide their own weaknesses, incompetence or to silence the target because the bully said something to the target that was inappropriate. Targets selected are often intelligent, innovative high achievers, with good integrity and principles. Mobbing activities appear trivial and innocuous on its own but the frequency and pattern of their occurrence over long period of time indicates an aggressive manipulation to “eliminate” the target.
Were you ever a victim of academic mobbing? Tell your story.  Email us at gumboeducation@gmail.com.  You can also send a voice recording. The voice recording may be used in future podcasts.

In this new episode, we get talking about disease control and the newborn coronavirus, why it's important to wash your hands, and the conspiracy around the supplements industry. After we take off our tinfoil hats we ask the biggest question of all...What is happiness and how to find balance in life? Taking over this weeks GymStreak Q&amp;A is the sleep cast episode slash intervention, which includes previously unheard special Navy Seals tricks on getting to sleep in two minutes and more.

We also discuss the obvious and not so obvious benefits of regular physical activity, touch on the evolutionary need for physical exertion, reflect on the origins of our fitness journey as well as update you on the latest developments on the app. Someone call the fire truck because this Friday we got burning hot questions about life, health and fitness. Weighted running, check. Stairmaster endurance test, check. Eating biscuits because - ""Well calories are calories!"" check. Difference between dirty bulking and clean bulking check. 

Welcome back to another release of GymStreak Q&amp;A Episode, where we come to you every Friday and answer your questions about health, fitness, motivation and of course the GymStreak app. This week, we have a bit of an experimental episode that has a slight change in pace.

Happily Active,"A podcast where you can listen to the evidence-base behind current health fads and interviews encouraging positive relationships with exercise, food and your body. Today we’ll be talking to Ellyn Bicknell  (@ellynbicknell) about her journey to completing her Masters in Nutrition and Dietetics. We discuss how growing up with persistent pain changed her views on exercise, the ongoing issue of medical misinformation and the importance of exploration of food and the environment. Today we’re joined by Evie (@eviekay) to talk about her love for yoga, her passion for helping others and the importance of self care. Evie shares her struggles with body image, how she changed her mindset towards exercise over time as well as how she got involved with volunteering for the Australian Red Cross. Today, Ash from Body Mind Full (@bodymindfull) tackles the increasingly popular topic of gut health. Ash has a Bachelors degree in Psychology, a Graduate Diploma in Nutrition and is an Associate Nutritionist. Ash helps us define gut health, talks about the impact of what we eat on the microbiome and discusses the evidence behind some popular gut health trends. Today we'll be talking to Georgia from GH Nutrition about her journey with Orthorexia and her passion for helping young women. We talk about how skinny does not mean happy, the role social media plays in how we perceive certain food groups and how to build a positive relationship with food.

Renée shares her journey to living a balanced holistic lifestyle as well as her passion for sustainability, low tox living and creating ""Love at First Swap"" and ""The Full Circle Store""."
Happily Ever ACTIVE with Kelly Doell,"Does your fitness journey feel more like a JOB than a JOY? With deep dives into important topics related to mindset, motivation, and much more, Dr. Kelly Doell (author of Feel Like It) exposes the real mental obstacles to our success. You'll also receive simple, actionable strategies to help you create the fiercely loyal relationship with exercise you need to get the benefits researchers rave about. Play creates transcendent exercise experiences. In such ""flow states"", we're distracted from how working our bodies is so healthy. Why? We're too busy solving problems, collaborating with others, and even laughing as we go. This week, Dale Sidebottom from Fitness Games Zone (and host of the Energetic Education podcast) joins me to discuss how to bring play to the table. I also feature one of his creations, Daily Mission Cards, which have added some refreshing, creative variety to play time with my 4-year-old.

That won’t magically happen on its own. So, let's engineer it. In this short episode, I list 9 steps for building a more enjoyable exercise routine:
1) Go Goalless
2) Reject ""No Pain, No Gain""
3) Know Your ""Type""
4) Try New Things
5) Attend to the Atmosphere
6) Bust up Binary Thinking
7) Manage Intensity Better
8) Monitor What Matters
9) Add Goals

Harder to Kill Radio,"Steph Gaudreau, NTP interviews top experts in fitness, nutrition, sleep, and mindset so you can apply their lessons to optimizing your own health and wellness. Discover how to improve your health using a multi-faceted, holistic approach so you can spend more time doing the things you enjoy in life instead of obsessing about diet and exercise. Steph weaves her science teaching experience with her nutritional therapy practitioner (NTP) and weightlifting training into a rich tapestry supplemented by the experiences of her expert guests to help you get stronger in mind, body, and spirit. Building body respect is all about coming back to our default states, without the pressure of shame or negativity. It takes an unlearning of what society has tried to tell us matters about our bodies and becoming at peace with the fact that your body is just one small piece of who you are. A few years ago I was introduced to intention setting, and it has changed the way I view my world. Setting an intention or a theme for your year can help you focus on being less frustrated with what you can’t figure out and more grateful for what is already in your life. In this episode, I am sharing my thoughts and intentions for my own journey in 2020 with you, and providing some insight into the full circle role meditation has played in this discovery.  We are all born as intuitive eaters, but through socialization and diet culture, we often drift away from the intuition that we hold from the beginning. I want to persuade you to get back to your true nature and increase your health-promoting behaviors through intuitive eating. As a woman, Dr. Jen Hosler believes you need to be doing some sort of strength or resistance training. A doctor of physical therapy as well as a personal trainer, Dr. Jen helps women navigate the intersection between their bodies and the physical and mental benefits of strength training. Providing a unique perspective as a physical therapist existing in the world of body image, fitness, and diet culture, Dr. Jen is here to tell you to stop obsessing over being perfect and start finding what works for you. The new year is often accompanied by self-judgment and ‘shoulds’ that make us feel horrible about ourselves. Instead of giving in to this global collective of exhaustion around wellness and the next diet trend, I invite you to embrace the new decade without the shame, blame and guilt cycle of societal standards. We are coming to the end of 2019, &amp; who wouldn’t want to start the new decade pain-free &amp; better functioning? Athletic trainer AJ Evans joins my husband Craig Zielinski &amp; I on this special 3-way live show to provide a double dose of banter &amp;info surrounding getting pain free in your everyday life."

Health Blueprints with Dave Catudal,"Get ready to expand your mind and discover new things about your health and your body. Dave Catudal's Health Blueprints Podcast is an immersive and enlightening health series covering all aspects of nutrition, fitness and holistic health. DAVE CATUDAL.Diagnostic Specialist & Celebrity Trainer.From Olympic athletes and Hollywood Stars to busy parents and pioneering entrepreneurs, Dave’s methods of natural healing and performance enhancement have helped thousands of people to improve their lives, reshape their bodies, and access their highest potential. Over the course of our lives we’ve essentially trained our body to become sugar-burners. Our dependency on “convenient” packaged foods and refined grains has results in a fundamentally carb-dominant diet, which is great if you’re an athlete who burns glycogen all day to power their hard working muscles for optimal strength and endurance output.

But if you work in an office and you’re eating like an athlete, there’s a problem.

The problem is that you’re taking in fuel (carbs) but you’re not burning them, so that energy is gonna to become saved for later. Guess how does your body saves unused energy…..

It converts it into fat, storing unused “fuel” in cells for future use.

In this podcast I show you how to shift your system into fat burning mode using a simple nutritional technique that you can do anytime. Many people have Leaky Gut and don't even know it. Leaky Gut is a term for a digestive disorder where your gut has issues absorbing nutrients and can't effectively protect itself against a variety of bacterias and pathogens, leading to a cascading effect of health complications. 

Shockingly, the same thing can happen to your Brain. 

Tune in to this eye-opening podcast where Craig Burton shares his view on Leaky Gut and Leaky Brain and explains how to improve this condition or prevent it from happening. Cortisol is a highly misunderstood hormone that tends to get a bad reputation as it’s widely known as our “stress hormone”, but Cortisol isn’t bad at all. It’s just a little bipolar and has special needs…. if we don’t give it love and take care of it, well, cortisol can act pretty crazy.

Here’s an example: Did you know that your body can actually MAKE sugar?

Tune in to discover the stress /gut health connection and learn how inflammation affects your body and mind. Is saturated fat good or bad?
Should I eat the egg yolk or throw it away?
Isn’t cholesterol bad for my heart?

These are just a few of the many questions that I get on a daily basis, and I can feel the stress and frustration that so many people have when it comes to the facts on fats. Unfortunately, as a society we’ve been mislead regarding the truth of what is actually healthy and we’ve become victims of the big fat lie. 

In this podcast I explain dietary fats in a practical way and show you the benefits they have to our body and our brain. Have you ever caught yourself saying something like this:

“I need energy, I should probably eat something” …

It’s ok, we all have.

But please understand this simple fact about being a human: You do NOT need to eat every few hours to provide your body with energy. You are literally walking around with a buffet of energy on you at all times, in the form of your fat cells.

In this podcast Clinical Nutritionist and Sports Scientist, Craig Burton explains Intermittent Fasting and his most effective methods to get the best results. You'll discover new things about Intermittent Fasting and what this nutritional hack really means to your body. Ketosis (Keto) is a highly misunderstood topic but it can be incredibly beneficial for people suffering with inflammatory issues, blood sugar issues or anyone who gets insatiable sugar cravings or have “Stubborn” body fat that they would like to lose. 

In this podcast I explain what ketosis is and the basic chemistry behind it, and my intention is to leave you feeling totally confident that you truly understand what keto is, what the benefits are, and what the potential challenges are. Get ready to learn all about your energy-making superpower!"
Health Coach Academy,"Cutting edge strategies for the Certified Health Coach!As Health Coaching becomes more popular by the day, it is vital that we are able to use all of the resources available to us to create thriving practices in order to provide our clients with results that they truly want. The Health Coach Academy interviews experts of various disciplines to help us understand the concepts that will make our business boom all while keeping up with the latest health and wellness trends so that we are better able to serve our clients.  Join us as we obtain the tools necessary to strengthen our industry’s reputation as major players in thehealth and wellness movement. One of the toughest markets to thrive in the health coaching space is the male market. Unfortunately men have a tendency to put their health on the backburner and seem to devalue its importance in comparison to our female counterparts. Luckily, we have the guys from the Vital Guide to give us some tips to even the playing field.

Michael DeSanti and Pablo Garcia join the show to share how they were able to succeed in the male market by showing men the value of a healthy lifestyle. As a health coach starting out, we can easily become overwhelmed with the amount of things that need to be done. It is easy to get paralyzed and not know where to start. The easiest way to resolve this is to simply, keep it simple!

Yamilette ""Dr. Yam""​ Williams, joins the show to share her strategies to start your dream health coaching practice. She also shares her ""Goodie Page"" with us full of freebies that can help us hone in on our best next steps! The 2020s will be a HUGE decade for the health coaching industry IF, health coaches get out of their own way. We need to identify and eliminate all of our limiting beliefs so that we can thrive in our businesses and meet the demands of our industry.

Mastin Kipp joins the show to discuss tools on how health coaches can overcome hidden blocks that keep us stuck. Mastin is an author and  speaker who Oprah Winfrey recognized as an ""up and coming thought leader of the next generation of spiritual thinkers"".  Businesses routinely invest in a wide range of areas to improve upon their profits. It is expected that a business spend money on equipment, advertising, accountants, and staffing to create an environment that promotes profitability.  Why wouldn’t a health coach practice operate the same way?

Kela Robinson Smith, a holistic Fertility and Hormone coach, joins the show to discuss how many health coaches mistakenly treat their practices more like a hobby instead of an actual business. As Health Coaches embark on the journey of entrepreneurship, one thing that quickly becomes apparent is the fact that we get in our own way more than we’d like. These behaviors, like self-sabotage and analysis paralysis, impact our ability to establish a flourishing business.

Midori Verity, founder of MOX Life has coined these behaviors behavioral loops.  She joins the show to discuss actionable steps that we can use to break down these patterns and take our businesses to another level. You don't have to be a Kardashian to be an influencer. In fact, you don't have to have a huge number of followers to truly be an influencer. To be a true influencer, health coaches need to use their expertise to get their message out and change lives while making money!

To discuss the steps necessary for this leap, Luana Ribeira joins the show. She shares her proven IMPACT system that takes experts to Influencer status."

But due to loopholes, there still may be antibiotics in conventional meats today which can affect our microbiome and potentially cause disease. With numerous types of diets out there today, how do you know which one you should follow and which one is right for you? Dr. Connie gives her take on diets this week. Our genes are the deck of cards we are dealt with when we are born. But it is our lifestyle and environment that determine whether those genes will develop health or disease. Dr. Connie discusses a new way to think about disease. Knowing what stage of Lupus you are currently in will help determine exactly what your body needs to heal. In this week's Lupus Q&amp;A, Dr. Connie discusses the benefits of taking turmeric/curcumin for inflammation, which vitamins to take while on Benlysta, and Omnacortil tablets.

 Find the full show notes at www.rachelafeldman.com/episode27 Today I have a dear friend on the podcast, Reed Davis.  Reed is not only the founder of Functional Diagnostic Nutrition, but he is what I like to call a health detective.  Reed helps his students and clients figure out how to navigate their health issues instead of just putting bandaids on them! 
  
 Over 20 years ago, Reed recognized people were caught in a “cycle of trial and error” and he committed to being the last person they needed to see.  While working with top leaders in alternative medicine, he ran thousands of labs on thousands of people and learned to identify “healing opportunities.”  Using all-natural, drug-free protocols, Reed made observations about who got better and who didn’t, codifying which “general principles of health building” would outperform “specific treatments” being provided by standard and even alternative medicine.  And through this work, he then developed the Functional Diagnostic Nutrition® Certification Course and D.R.E.S.S. for Health Success Protocol® to educate and empower as many people as possible about how to get well and stay well naturally, so they, in turn, may empower others to do the same.
 
 

 In today’s interview we will discuss:
  
  The reasons some women don’t get their hormones back into balance  The importance of looking at your client’s health as a whole Testing for medical conditions and the underlying causes  The importance of looking at upstream factors to get to the underlying causes and conditions  Working with a functional practitioner Looking at healing opportunities in the different areas of the body  The importance of working with a doctor who will “co-work” with you  Getting past our symptoms so we can get to high performance  Why individuality is so important to remember when working with clients  Detoxification is not a one-time thing: it’s a journey How to determine what diet is right for you    
 It’s so important to remember that the general principles of health building will always outperform specific treatment.  If you are working with clients and stuck in the what to do next phase or even stuck in your own health, I encourage you to listen to this whole episode so you can make sure you have some of these fundamentals in place.   Issues can be cleared up significantly with food and detoxifying your system. It’s important to remember that sometimes you will need extra support as well. 

That wraps up our episode for today! Remember that you can reach out to me and I would be happy to connect you with a functional medicine practitioner.  I can also connect you with Reed and his amazing school so you can educate yourself and take yourself on your path to wellness.  
  
 Thanks for tuning in…. that’s all for today! See you next week. 
 XO, 
 Rach

 In today’s interview we will discuss:
  
  The importance of building a solid foundation in your business Why you need to concentrate on generating leads and sales for your business The importance of a really powerful lead magnet that makes your audience feel seen and heard  Using a quiz to build and segment your email list  Being specific: The more specific you can get the higher your conversions will be Why people are so afraid of segmenting their list  The differences in the types of quizzes and which one might be right for your business How to automate the process of getting to know someone The importance of knowing your clients so you can support them the way they want to be supported Why human interaction is so important   
 

 See….I told you! Chanti’s amazing!  I hope this episode really opened up your eyes to the many ways you can use a quiz in your health coaching business.  Use your quiz as a way to bring in new leads for your business.

 Wondering what type of quiz you should create for your online biz? &gt;&gt; Take me to the quiz On today’s episode, I get to talk with Michael Jones, who is all the way in Bangkok, Thailand! Michael is a health coach who is straight-up going to tell you what it took for him to build his business and what it took for him to not be in the constant struggle to keep his business growing. 
  
 In today’s interview, we will discuss:
  How Micheal niched down and the process it took for him to get there  Why copying other coaches techniques don’t work for everyone The process of turning comments and likes into paying clients  Why you need to test, test, and then invest in your business How to navigate the digital space and cut through the BS as a coach who is trying to grow their business.  1:1 coaching vs. group coaching The importance of using a Facebook page to educate, share your knowledge and provide free content so you can build trust with your audience Real-life connections turning into online clients.   Michael sums everything up brilliantly by reminding us that we should be talking to the ones who are going to really listen to your message and be inspired by it.  Don’t always worry about everything being online- think in-person and those in-person interactions will convert to online. 
  
 If you are struggling with your health make sure you go and follow Micheal! I can't tell you how many of you guys I've seen in forums mention pain! You're just struggling, there are solutions, get the solution for yourself, then pay it forward! 
 Show notes available at www.rachelafeldman.com/episode24 We all see the pretty you can make X amount of money. We all see the wonderful ads. But it’s a different thing when you actually get to talk to someone like Chris. Chris is an open book when it comes to his personal struggles, with mindset, and the daily battles he faces.
  
 About Chris:
  
 Chris Winfield AKA The Super Connector™ is the founder of Unfair Advantage and columnist for Entrepreneur and INC he knows this: looking out for yourself will only get you so far. But building relationships will get you further. 
  
 His writings have also appeared in Business Insider, TIME, Buffer, and other top-tier publications.

Chris has shown clients – including people from companies like Disney, Bai Brands, Virgin, Intuit, Cali’Flour Foods, and countless high profile entrepreneurs &amp; authors – how to leverage their connections with the media and influencers for credibility, authority &amp; profit.
 
 

 In today’s interview we will discuss: 
  
  What it takes daily to show up as your best self. How to actually grow a business, how to stay in business and not crash and burn. Why mindset matters, how being positive comes more naturally to some than others, and what to do about it.  What to do with feelings of inadequacy. Why connections and meaningful relationships are so important in your life and business.  Chris’s daily routine that he does to prevent burn out. Why you have to have accountability in your life and business.  
 
 
 

 We talked a lot about connecting and why it is so unbelievably important. Not just connecting but connecting and building meaningful relationships with people that build you up and encourage you on your journey. That might mean letting go of certain relationships in your life or blocking people online!
  
 Chris shares from such a place of authenticity. It’s so easy to look at somebody like we all do on social media and think they’ve got it figured it out. They’ve got this. They’ve got that. Christ shares that you don’t always have it figured out. We continuously have to do the same thing; share, connect with people, be honest about our feelings, our fears, and catch yourself when we get into that fast-paced mindset.
  
 I would love to hear what you guys thought of today’s episode. Don’t forget to tag me on Instagram @rachelafeldman and share with me your biggest takeaway.

  Why many people believe they need to start their business online  Getting back to the basics and why the most important thing you need to be doing is educating others and sharing your story  The mindset issues you must overcome when starting out  The importance of not comparing your business to someone else’s  Start simple and go from there- what is your audience asking you about? How you can use offline relationships to build confidence  Failing forward.  Accept the places where you feel like something isn’t totally right  Why some of the marketing you are doing may actually be taking you away from showing up and connecting with your potential clients  How to build structure in your business  How Sharon added a level of lab testing to her business  and how it helps her clients The importance of an individualized approach. What worked years ago is not going to work now.  I had so much fun chatting with Sharon today.  I love how she brings everything back to the basics.  You must find the blueprint that works for you and your business and learn how to pivot as your business evolves.

Healthy Tips After 50 Podcast,"Are you over 50 and starting to realize that “being healthy” feels different than it did 15, 10, or even 5 years ago? Looking for healthy tips that will make you feel better at your current age? Curious about those new health & wellness books with interesting titles about aging well, living longer, brain health & memory, or keto diets? If you said “yes” to any of these then you need to listen to my weekly Healthy Tips After 50 Podcast where I share with you not only what I’ve learned over the past 30 years from my own health challenges but how we can all live and be well through the next 30 or more. Good Posture for Strong Muscles
 Posture-related muscle weakness and rigidity can develop as you get older. Poor posture can affect your balance, strength, and flexibility and lead to chronic pain. There are many exercises that can help to improve your posture. Not surprisingly yoga is good for improving your posture, it seems to be good for everything! Tai Chi is also good for you.
 You want to strengthen your upper body, arms, back, and abdomen to help hold your torso erect. Get in the habit of checking your posture at all times, no matter what you’re doing, but especially when you are eating, at the computer, driving, standing in a line to checkout or buy something. Check your posture at various times of day until you find that you are doing it naturally and don’t need to adjust yourself anymore.
 You can leave me comments, questions, and topic suggestions on my webpage Healthy Tips After 50 or on my  Facebook Page. I very much enjoy hearing from all of you. Managing Stress - Is It Possible?
 Manage your stress to maintain longer term memory and brain capacity. Learn about how fast stress can injure your brain (it doesn't take very long) and what to do to avoid the negative consequences. Some stress is good for you - it's like exercising your brain and your vascular system. After a short stress period your brain and body should go back to normal.
 A few things you can do to help you deal with stress are laugh, meditate, get a massage, and/or journal. Exercise is one of the best things for your body and your brain - pick one or many different ones - the important thing is to be consistent so find ones you enjoy!
 BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) helps your hippocampus to create new brain cells. You can help increase your BDNF by exercising (there it is again), social interaction, cultural activities (plays, movies, museums, etc.), as well as coffee fruit extract (not beans). There are various supplements these days that include coffee fruit and I've included a few Amazon links to them below.
 100% Pure Hawaiian Coffeeberry Coffee Fruit Extract (Coffea arabica) (1oz)
 Garden of Life Dr. Formulated Organic Brain Health Memory &amp; Focus for Adults 40+
 Coffee Cascara, CATURRA TEA, Natural Focus 120g Organic

 SAD (seasonal affective disorder) is a type of depression that is caused by the shorter days of late fall and early winter. The symptoms are similar to those of typical depression - feelings of hopelessness, fatigue, loss of interest in activities they usually enjoy, difficulty concentrating, etc.
 The difference is that SAD only happens seasonally not all year round. Doctors usually prescribe antidepressants and/or light therapy depending on how severe the symptoms are.
 There is also a less usual type of SAD which occurs in the summertime but there is less known about that and staying out of the daylight is one of the suggestions given for that.
 I also talk about the Free 5-Day Training, Say Goodbye to Overwhelm, I'm running January 15-19 in Facebook. Here's the link to sign up for Say Goodbye to Overwhelm. How to Cleanup Your Clutter
 How has clutter impacted your life? It's a very controversial subject, especially with people at both ends of the spectrum - hoarders &amp; obsessive cleaners. I am not a hoarder but do tend to be on that side of the middle point. 
 The article I quote from in the UC Berkeley Wellness Letter, included an interesting Q&amp;A with Michael Tompkins, Ph.D. at UC Berkeley about clutter which I go through in the podcast.
 Tompkins talks about other issues that go along with large amounts of clutter - e.g. allergens and mold in areas that can't or haven't been cleaned in awhile. He also mentions the risk of tripping over the clutter and social isolation.
 There are also some suggestions on how to go about decluttering which were helpful and that I have actually tried myself. Needless to say I also make quite a few comments during the podcast on my experience (past and current) with clutter and clean obsessions. Let me know in the comments what your experience with clutter has been.
 They also mention Marie Kondo's book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing. You can get your own copy on Amazon at the link above. Closing Out 2019
  3 new items of interest to bring 2019 to an end. Green Tea Extract (GTE) as a supplement has been used by a lot of postmenopausal women to try and lower their breast cancer risk. A NIH-funded study found that instead of reducing cancer risk GTE actually raised the risk when compared to a group taking a placebo whose risk went down. A separate study had previously found that high-dose GTE in weight-loss supplements can cause liver damage. The second item is that there is an increased risk of Dementia associated with a class of medication called ""anticholinergics"" (I mangle the pronunciation of that word in the podcast). Those medications vary from the well known, Benadryl, Paxil, &amp; Dimetapp, to a number I'd never heard of including Toviaz, Urispas, Desyrel, &amp; a few others. If you are taking an anticholinergic drug then you should go and talk to your doctor about changing to another medication if possible. Number three I included in honor of the New Year - Should you make New Year's resolutions if you are likely to break them? The answer isn't a clear yes or no. It depends on whether you keep making the same one each year and never get it done. In that case you should probably look at what is stopping you from achieving your goal and address that first. Starting the new year with a new goal can improve your mood by activating your brain's pleasure centers. But in general, you should be able to set and achieve goals any time of the year.  Lastly, I shared my intention for 2020 which is to start doing interviews with other people who are in Health &amp; Wellness. That includes not just people involved with Health but also others who work in Wellness, as in improving one's overall life which would then also improve your Health. It's going to be an exciting year ahead! I'm glad you're here and would appreciate you telling your friends and family about the podcast. I really want to expand and improve the Healthy Tips After 50 Podcast! Don't forget to go and check out the Healthy Tips After 50 Website for additional information.   Meditation for Calming Fearful Memories
 Volunteers trained in Mindfulness Meditation were able to break their ""anxiety habit"" caused by fearful memories. In this study the researchers used ""safety memories"" to help the participants in conjunction with the mindfulness meditation to do this.
 They also learned through mindfulness how to stop judging their own thoughts. Overall the meditation group did better than the control group who used exercise based stress management. Meditation classes are available in many community centers, spiritual/buddhist communities, senior centers, YMCA's, etc. You can easily find one near you.
 There's a short ""holiday"" tip having to do with wrapping gifts and creating expectations. Don't disappoint the person you are gifting by wrapping your gift ""inappropriately"".

https://kidsunderconstruct.wixsite.com/kidunderconstruction?fbclid=IwAR3cyMeVPkEqLzP3NGptxdaUMxqjjZNNRqGkJK3yY2zrVguX8DN-C6eZKO4 Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  The most appealing benefit is that breakfast jumpstarts the metabolism and, helps burn more calories throughout the day. When children eat breakfast it’s telling their body that there are plenty of calories to be had for the day.  It helps them pay better attention in school and to consume key nutrients they need to grow, like calcium and complex carbohydrates and healthy fats.

Russell National School Lunch Act, signed into law by President Harry Truman in 1946.  Since them millions of familys benefit from this option on a daily basis.  Several systems are in place to offer healthy options and feed children during the day.  The USDA provides strict guidelines which makes sure schools prepare a balance of fruits, vegetables, dairy and good portion size to help growing children.   The National School Breakfast Program is an awesome option for children who aren't able to eat at home.  We will discuss the program origin, how a child will qualify, the requirements for the school, and the price tag associated with this program.  The federal government has created this program to help families that really need the help.  Milliions of families participate during the school year and some even during the summer. "

Heilsumál,"Heilsumál er þáttur um allt er varðar heilsu og heilsutengd málefni. Í þessum þætti ræðum við um hvað einkennir góð samskipti og hvernig getum við tileinkað okkur betri samskipti almennt og í samböndum við annað fólk, ekki síst í parsamböndum.

Viðmælandi okkar að þessu sinni er Thedor Francis Birgisson klínískur félagsráðgjafi.  Einn eigendum Lausnarinnar, fjölskyldu og áfallamiðstöðvar.

Theodór er hafsjór fróðleiks. Hans sérsvið eru samskipti, hjóna- og sambandsmál, fjölskylduerfiðleikar, samskipti eftir skilnað, sorgarvinna, samskipti á vinnustað,  kvíði og samskiptaörðugleikar.

Virðing og hlustun
Í þættinum fer Theodór einnig yfir mikilvæg atriði í góðum samskiptum, s.s. gagnkvæma virðingu og mikilvægi þess að hlusta á hvort annað. Eins og kemur fram í þættinum þá 

Meðvirkni og samskipti í fjölskyldum
Eins og Theodór bendir á, þá er vel hægt að vera hreinskilinn í samskiptum án þess að meiða og mikilvægt er að setja mörk. Guðbjörn Gunnarsson einka- og markþjálfi fjallar hér um mörg mikilvæg atriði sem við þurfum öll að fá að heyra og tileinka okkur.   Guðbjörn nefnir mikilvægi þess að framkvæma einskonar „ástandsskoðun“ þegar fólk kemur í þjálfun. Hún er nauðsynleg segir hann til margra hluta, ekki síst til að skoða hvað hefur virkað vel fyrir viðkomandi og hvað ekki. Einnig er hún mikilvæg til að hafa viðmið og það auðveldar yfirsýn og fylgjast með árangri.

Guðbjörn hvetur fólk til að keppast frekar við mittismál frekar en þyngd. Einnig hvetur hann fólk til að sinna andlega þætti þjálfunar og í lífinu almennt.  Það er lykilatriði svo að fólk geti orðið besta útgáfan af sjálfum sér. Sund er meinhollt segir Guðmundur Hafþórsson íþróttafræðingur og sundþjálfari.  Hann ræðir hér um heilsufarslegan ávinning af sundiðkun fyrir alla aldurshópa óháð þjálfunarástandi og fyrri afrekum. Gestur okkar í dag er Jóhannes Kári Kristinsson augnlæknir. Hann fræðir okkur um leiðir til betri sjónar og augnheilsu. Guðríður Helgadóttir garðyrkjufræðingur er gestur okkar að þessu sinni. Hún gefur hér góð ráð varðandi matjurtaræktun og fer yfir þær tegundir sem við getum ræktað og hvernig er best að bera sig að."
HELDENstunde. Für ein gesundes und bewusstes Leben.,"In der HELDENstunde gibt Gastgeber Alexander Metzler mit Hilfe von Experten Tipps und Tricks zur Verbesserung der wichtigsten Lebensbereiche. Hierzu zählen unter anderem Gesundheit, Ernährung, mentale Stimmung, Schlaf, Fitness, Geld, Arbeit, Kommunikation, Konsum, Umwelt und das Leben als Ganzes. Viele Menschen träumen von der Selbständigkeit als Weg zur beruflichen und persönlichen Freiheit.
 Doch bedeutet das eigene Business wirklich Freiheit?
 Der eine traut sich nie, die andere stürzt sich blind hinein. Und wieder andere bauen sie Schritt für Schritt auf: Die berufliche Selbständigkeit. Das Konzept lockt mit Freiheit, Selbstverwirklichung, Glück und finanzieller Unabhängigkeit. Soweit die Theorie.
 Zu Gast in der HELDENstunde ist diesmal Anne Rödiger. Anne hat sich bereits in jungen Jahren mit Personal Training selbständig gemacht. Wir sprechen über die Herausforderungen bei der Gründung, von allzu optimistischer Herangehensweise, von Typsache und von Unterschieden in den Generationen.
 In dieser HELDENstunde hörst du:
  Wie uns das familiäre Umfeld bei der Berufswahl prägt Welche Fallstricke beim Einstieg in die Selbständigkeit lauern Wie das finanzielle Risiko beim Start gesenkt werden kann Die Vor- und Nachteile im Angestellten-Verhältnis Die Vor- und Nachteile in der Selbständigkeit Vom Homeoffice und seinen Herausforderungen Von der fehlenden Struktur als Selbständiger Wie man eigene Regeln aufbaut, um dauerhaft leistungsfähig zu bleiben Dass Geduld eine Tugend ist Von falschen Erwartungen Warum es eine gute Idee ist Aufgaben auszulagern Warum wir die Entscheidung zur Selbständigkeit nicht bereuen  Anne Rödiger: Personal Trainerin bei lebefederleicht.de

 Youtube Das neue Jahrzehnt hat begonnen. Die Erwartungen sind möglicherweise hoch.
 Doch warum sollte sich unser Leben verändern? Das wird es nicht. Es sei denn...
 Es gibt nur eine Möglichkeit, das Leben zu verändern. In dem wir uns selbst verändern.
 Der ""State of mind"", also der Zustand des inneren Friedens oder Glücks, bestimmt unseren Blick auf die Welt. Dieser Zustand bestimmt darüber, wie und was wir in der Welt wahrnehmen. Er ist das Ergebnis unseres bisherigen Lebens. Das Leben ist die Summe aller getroffenen Entscheidungen und wird bestimmt durch unserer Gewohnheiten.
 Hier kommt die gute Nachricht. Aus Entscheidungen können wir lernen und Gewohnheiten können wir ändern. Das ist der Hebel!
 In dieser HELDENstunde hörst du:
  Einen Rückblick über die Themenschwerpunkte der HELDENstunde Kurze Tipps zum Thema Ernährung Kurze Tipps zum Thema Bewegung Kurze Tipps zum Thema soziale Interaktion Kurze Tipps zum Thema Schlaf Zahlreiche Tipps zur Überprüfung und Anpassung der eigenen Gewohnheiten Dass du deinen ""inneren Raum"" sauber halten solltest Wie du negative Energien abbauen kannst Wie du Distanz zwischen Dich und eine Situation im Außen bringst Welche beiden Maßnahmen den größten Impact auf mich hatten  Mehr zur HELDENstunde:

 Youtube Adventszeit, Weihnachten, Silvester. Viele Events warten auf uns zum Jahresende.
 Doch wie werden wir all den Erwartungen gerecht und kommen möglichst stressfrei durch die Feiertage?
 Wir haben gelernt, dass Weihnachten und die Zeit bis Silvester eine besondere Zeit ist. Bedeutungsschwer, voller Rückblicke und Wünsche für die Zukunft. Entsprechend hoch ist die Erwartungshaltung an die Feiertage. Doch je höher die Erwartungen, desto größer das Potential enttäuscht zu werden.
 Wenn wir es also schaffen, diese Zeit von erhöhten Erwartungen, Perfektionismus und Konsumterror zu entkoppeln, bietet sich die Chance auf einen wirklich entspannten Jahreswechsel. Auch diese Zeit ist am Ende nur ein Konstrukt unserer Gedanken.
 In dieser HELDENstunde hörst du:
  Dass wir die Feiertage von überzogenen Erwartungen entkoppeln sollten Lustige Geschichten zu Weihnachten Kulturelle Unterschiede zwischen Deutschland und Spanien zu Weihnachten Von ursprünglichen Traditionen fernab vom Konsumzwang Dass Veränderungen unvermeidbar sind und warum wir uns darüber freuen sollten Vom Paradoxon des Tuns und der Wichtigkeit Wie ein einziges Wort das Leben beeinflussen kann – Annehmen!

 Youtube Die Frage nach dem Sinn des Lebens stellt sich die Menschheit vermutlich von Beginn an. Man kann sich gut vorstellen, dass bereits in grauer Vorzeit der Blick zu den Sternen ging und die Frage nach dem großen Warum gestellt wurde... 
 Dies unterscheidet uns (vermutlich) unter anderem von unseren tierischen und pflanzlichen Mitgeschöpfen.  Ich jedenfalls habe noch keine Kuh auf der Weide gesehen, die sich die Warum-Frage stellte. Oder ein Apfelbaum, der versucht hat, die Unendlichkeit des Universums zu begreifen :D Aber wer weiß schon genau, was in anderen/m vorgeht? 
 Wir sind nun mal Menschen und daher in der Lage, über solche Dinge nach zu denken. Das Problem allerdings könnte sein, dass wir versuchen Antworten im außen, also in der Welt außerhalb von uns, in der Welt der Formen zu finden. Das könnte schwierig werden. Denn alles, was entsteht, vergeht auch wieder. Wie soll so also Sinn entstehen? Wenden wir also nach innen und schauen mal, ob dort etwas ""sinn-stiftendes"" (einer meiner Lieblingswörter) zu finden ist zur Frage nach dem Sinn des Lebens.
 In dieser Folge hört ihr:
  Warum eine Bestimmung nicht wichtig ist Weshalb die Suche im außen vermutlich sinnlos ist Dass Bewusstsein zur Verbundenheit führt Warum dieser Bewusstseins-Prozess außerdem wichtig ist Von zwei Schlüsseln die vielleicht unsere Zivilisation retten könnten Wie ich versuche aus Zitronen Zitronenlimonade zu machen Die ultimative Antwort auf die Frage nach dem Sinn des Lebens  Mehr zur HELDENstunde: www.heldenstun.de

 In dieser Folge gibt es 5 easy Tipps, die sich positiv auf gleich alle drei Bereiche auswirken.
 Oft hängen positive Einflüsse auf die eigene Gesundheit direkt oder indirekt auch mit unserer Umwelt und den eigenen Finanzen zusammen.
 Ist erst ein Bewusstsein für diese Verbindung hergestellt, können gleich 3 Fliegen mit einer Klappe geschlagen werden. 
 In dieser Folge hört ihr
  Die positiven Auswirkungen auf Gesundheit, Umwelt und Finanzen bzgl.:  Kaltem duschen Bewegung statt Auto Dem Rauchen aufhören Selbst kochen Verzicht auf Sylvester-Raketen    Passt gut zur Folge:
 HS #038 – Mit dem Rauchen aufhören – mit Isabell Drescher Mentale Beeinflussung oder Hypnose hat mich schon als kleiner Junge fasziniert. Allerdings eher aus dem Bereich Unterhaltung.
 Hypnose wird aber mittlerweile vor allem im gesundheitlichen Bereich eingesetzt.
 Im Wachzustand sind vor allem die Betawellen im Gehirn messbar. Ein Mentalcoach oder Hypnotiseur kann das Gehirn mittels einer leichten Trance in den Zustand der Alpha- bzw. Thetawellen. Eine Trance ist nichts anderes als ein entspannter Zustand. So ist man aufnahmefähiger für neue Impulse.
 Unser heutiger Gast ist Dr. Marco Rathschlag. Er ist Experte für Mentalcoaching, Universitäts-Dozent, Ausbilder und Speaker.
 In der heutigen HELDENstunde hört ihr
  Was Hypnose ist Welche Wellen im Wach- und im Trancezustand aktiv sind Wie sich Hypnose anfühlt In welchen Bereichen mentales Training helfen kann Der Unterschied zwischen Meditation und Hypnose Wie die Technik der Muster-Unterbrechung funktioniert Dass Hypnose auf Zusammenarbeit beruht Wie Gedanken und Körperkraft zusammen hängt Wie Alex hypnotisiert wird Wie (Selbst-)Hypnose unseren Alltag verbessern kann  Die kostenlosen Audio-Dateien zur Selbsthypnose findet ihr unter:

High On Healthy,"Infusing the benefits of proper nutrition, supplementation, and personal development to live a healthy and abundant life! Phoenix, Arizona-based nutrition and wellness center owner and health coach Audrey Kerger will be your personal advocate for living a healthy and active lifestyle. Audrey Kerger speaks with Rob Smith, the General Manager of Phoenix, Arizona-based Emerald Dispensary and Infusion Edibles.

Emerald Dispensary features two Arizona-based locations in Phoenix and Gilbert. Infusion edibles and concentrates are made with the patient in mind. As one of the first medical cannabis kitchens in Arizona, our goal has always been to provide high quality products with outstanding flavor, while delivering safe, consistent and effective medication. By using only gourmet ingredients and the most sophisticated extraction methods, we maintain that same goal each and every day.

Our high level of standard can be found in everything we do. Whether it’s our preparation, extraction science, testing, order fulfillment, fast delivery or our team of experts, we only incorporate the best elements and the best people to ensure we create and deliver the finest line of products. Today on High On Healthy we are joined by Jill Ellsworth, Founder, and CEO of Willows Industries. Fueled by her passion for innovation and dedication to health, Jill has made a career of creating solutions for better living. Prior to launching Willow Industries in 2015, Jill founded Vibrant Earth Juices (VEJ), a Santa Barbara-based cold-pressed organic juice company. Named Female Entrepreneur of the Year in Emerging Business in 2013, Jill became passionate about pasteurization techniques, employing High-Pressure Processing (HPP) to prevent microbial growth and increase the shelf-life and freshness for her juice line. Later, Jill parlayed VEJ into a beverage distribution company, helping place various alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages in Whole Foods, King Soopers, Natural Grocers, yoga studios, coffee shops, and other healthy eating establishments. Jill, who serves on the Cannabis Health and Safety Advisory Committee for the City of Denver, is a Registered Dietitian and Nutritionist. She holds an MS in Nutrition, Dietetics, &amp; Food Science, a BA in Communications and a BS in Nutrition from California State University, Northridge and Cal Poly San Louis Obispo. Today on High On Healthy we are joined by Ellen Jackson. Ellen is a successful entrepreneur and life coach with Sync Life 1320, which focuses on guiding and supporting you towards your purpose in life. Through life coaching and retreats, one can expect insightful experiences and personal growth. It’s important to learn we are ever-changing masterpiece’s in motion, rooted in cosmic timelessness. They speak about some of the greatest challenges met and how she overcame them. Also the most wonderful experiences and memories she has created in the cannabis industry. Today on High On Healthy we are joined by Josh Crossney from the Cannabis Science Conference and JCanna. Cannabis Science Conference is the world's largest and most technical cannabis science expo. CSC pulls together cannabis industry experts, instrument manufacturers, testing labs, research scientists, medical practitioners, policy makers and interested novices. The annual event is aimed at improving cannabis science. jCanna, Inc., is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization comprised of affiliates including cannabis industry insiders, scientists, medical doctors, policymakers and interested novices working together to advance awareness of legal, medicinal cannabis related topics. Their affiliates work to share insights and advance solutions to improve cannabis analytical testing technologies. Today High On Healthy we are joined by David Krantz, Epigenetic Health Coach. David carries his family’s music history into the future (his great grandfather was a composer in Krakow, Poland before WWII and his Aunt is an accomplished opera singer) as he leans heavily on skillful synthetic sound design, reprocessed acoustic sound sources, and crisp production. One of the rare producers who can transcend the typical barriers between electronic dance music and traditional composition, David is at home in a variety of contexts and settings. Spanning the range between heavy bass music and contemplative downtempo, his versatility, depth of expression, and command over detail has earned him accolades from some of the most respected minds in forward thinking electronic music. Futexture is music for music lovers. Its music written in homage to the boundless majesty of nature, the complexity and strangeness of human relationships, and the ineffable nature of individual experience. It is the merger of tradition and the incalculable future, dancing together on the razor thin edge of now. It is what happens when David Krantz, a North Carolina native and multi instrumentalist, titrates his experience into sound. Today on High On Healthy our host is joined by Cannabis Educator &amp; Industry Consultant, Emma Chasen. Emma has a mission to educate people on the science behind cannabis so that they may take charge of their own healing. After graduating from Brown University in 2014 with a degree in Medicinal Plant Research, Emma went on to coordinate Clinical Oncology trials with the Brown University Oncology Research Group. When her supervisor refused a cannabis trial in favor of another expensive pharmaceutical drug, Emma quit and headed across the country to Portland, OR. She found her way to Farma, the popular Portland dispensary that takes a more scientific approach to cannabis; rejecting the Indica/Sativa binary and instead focusing on chemo types to determine effect. She began her career at Farma as a bud-tender and was quickly promoted to General Manager after only a few months. She oversaw the operations of the shop and continued to uphold the pillars of esteemed customer service and cannabis science education during the rocky regulatory transition from OHA to OLCC governance."

Our mission is to debunk the bro-science and make the real science more accessible! Have you ever seen someone pee a little during a CrossFit workout? I remember watching the CrossFit Games a few years back and seeing it happen live on TV during box jumps. Sometimes, urinary incontinence is an indicator of pelvic floor weakness. In others, it can manifest as low-back pain. In this special episode, Dr. Lankford and I speak with Dr. Laura Meihofer, an expert in assessing and treating pelvic floor dysfunction.

Naturally, for this episode's segment Bro Science B******t, we ask Britt what kind of fun advice she's seen among fitness influencers for exercise during pregnancy. We all know fitness Instagram can get weird, but according to Britt ""pregnancy fitness Instagram"" is next level! Follow Brittany on IG and Twitter for regular research-based updates and be sure to hit us up with your questions on exercise during pregnancy and children and resistance training @fitnphys! This episode digs deep into the definition, interpretation and all the various ways in which we use the word ""Calories"". Dr Lankford and Dr Bennion dissect Calories in vs Calories out for weight loss, and how there are multiple factors contributing to weight loss that are higher priorities than energy balance, and debate whether energy balance really should be the foundation that many fitness professionals claim that it is. We address the Calories stored in a pound of fat, and how that figure gets misinterpreted for building muscle and the Calories needed to gain healthy weight as well. We talk about these topics and so much more in this powerfully deep episode all about reassessing Calories! Dr. Lankford and I invite special guest, Dr. Rob Thiebaud to the show to discuss his research and expertise in blood flow occlusion and resistance training!
 
Go to https://www.fitnphys.training/ for all the links to further research Dr. Thiebaud suggests! In this episode, Dr Lankford and I talk about common misunderstandings among fitness professionals. We start by addressing ""lactic acid"" and how it's used so regularly ... while not necessarily being the most accurate description. And then the conversation turns into fitness business stuff, and how fitness professionals often feel the influences of the fitness industry defining/limiting their talents and skills. Eli proposes an interesting and profound analogy that an exercise science degree is like a bike without pedals - that on its own it's nearly impossible to be productive. But that we must attach out own pedals to that bike to really make it take off. In what ways do you attach pedals to your bike? Let us know the coolest and most creative things you're doing personally, or that you've experienced among fitness professionals, to develop and push health and fitness into a better space! Dr. Bennion and Dr. Lankford talk about what it's like to conduct exercise science research and why certain research methodologies can be tricky"

 Shannon Martinez is not your everyday average Hike it Baby mom. First of all she is a mother of seven with children ranging from 2 years old to 21 years old. Second of all she has never actually formally hiked with a Hike it Baby group, but considers herself an active member because she participates in the Hike it Baby 30 and is involved in the Facebook groups located about an hour from her. Lastly she has a crazy backstory as a former Neo-Nazi skinhead who participated in hate crimes, which has led her to speaking at the UN and forming a nonprofit called Freeradicals.org that helps people come to terms with their extremist past and move on. One of the ways she encourages people to move on from hate is to find community. But she also preaches that parents who find groups like Hike it Baby and engage early on with their children in nature, are less likely to raise children who head down the path toward extremism. Learn more about her story and how a group like Hike it Baby could be the solution for helping our planet heal and move toward raising more resilient children.  Hear from Linda McGurk, author of “There's No Such Thing as Bad Weather: A Scandinavian Mom's Secrets for Raising Healthy, Resilient, and Confident Kids.” In this episode Shanti Hodges talks to Bekah Quirin who is hiking the entire Appalachian Trail with her husband and 16 month old daughter.

Hive Life,"“Hive Life” tells memorable stories, features in-depth conversations and shares hard-won secrets of success from the Hive, Honey Stinger’s remarkable community of athletes and adventurers. Every episode will deliver two important things: Inspiration and proven advice. We share personal stories of adversity, triumph and growth through insightful interviews with top athletes, delving inside their minds and athletic lives. To help listeners achieve their own goals, we also will reveal these athletes’ best advice on nutrition, training, mental toughness, and other essential topics. By exploring the commonality of sport—the idea that all athletes, regardless of their level of ability or sport of choice, can inspire and learn from one another—the show will create a kind of Hive mind that enables everyone in the group to improve and achieve their goals. Hosted by David Willey, former editor-in-chief of Runner’s World and founding host of “The Runner’s World Show” podcast. The first episode of the new year is a sports-nutrition special featuring Kayla Martin, a consultant with Honey Stinger and the Director for Performance Nutrition at Penn State University. Kayla, who’s also a runner, talks about how she balances the needs of the 800 athletes under her nutritional care, about what you should eat and—just as crucially—when you should eat it, and about how both of those priorities vary from sport to sport and athlete to athlete. In our first episode recorded in front of a live audience, at the New York Road Runners’ RUN CENTER in Manhattan, host David Willey talks with 8 Hive athletes the day before they ran the TCS New York City Marathon. The runners, a mix of elites, first-timers and avid athletes who've overcome adversity share their hard-earned insights into training, nutrition, motivation and the power of the running community. Ultrarunner Courtney Dauwalter talks with host David Willey a few weeks after completing 143 miles at the 24-Hour World Championships, despite a hip injury that had caused a rare DNF at the Western States 100 in June. Courtney discusses that “wake-up call,” as well as her unorthodox training methods, how she fuels herself for such long races, and the time she went blind during a 100-mile race...and continued running anyway. She also shares what she loves so much about this demanding, transcendent sport. Episode 16 is our first on-the-ride interview, with track cyclist, Mandy Marquardt, who races for team Novo Nordisk. To give you a sense for what it’s like to sprint around a track at over 40 mph, we mic'd Mandy during a short but lung-searing acceleration known as a jump. Mandy is an 18-time national champion and a 2-time U.S. national record-holder. She talks about how important nutrition is in managing her Type 1 diabetes, her goals and the hardest but most fulfilling parts of this fascinating sport. November is Diabetes Awareness Month, and in the next two episodes we’re featuring Team Novo Nordisk, the world’s first all-diabetes professional cycling team. Lakota Phippen, one of the team's most inspiring athletes, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 24. Fueling properly can be tough for any athlete and even harder for diabetics. Lakota talks about managing the disease, what it's like to inject himself with insulin during a race, and why, for him, honey is the lifeblood of much-needed energy. Episode 14 features our second on-the-run interview—a revealing conversation between host David Willey and Achilles NYC runners Brooke Danielson and Melissa Blume. Brooke guides Mel, who is legally blind, throughout the run just like she will in the TCS New York City Marathon. You'll hear how Brooke goes about keeping Mel safe—although that's not all she does—and appreciate how grit, fearlessness and friendship make difficult things not just possible, but worth doing in the first place."
HMMR Podcast,"Nick Garcia and Martin Bingisser of HMMR Media discuss the top topics in strength and conditioning and the world of elite sports training. After leading athletes to 24 NCAA titles in 15 years, throws coach Dave Dumble packed up and headed north to take on a new challenge of building a program from scratch at Oregon State University. On this week's podcast Dumble joins us to talk about the move, what he is building at Corvallis, his coaching philosophy, and more.

You can also find him on Instagram (@CoachDumble) and Twitter (@CoachDumble). We've had several other former UCLA throwers on the podcast, including  Suzy Powell last week,  John Godina,  John Frazier, and  Don Babbitt. We also discussed my interview with Adam Nelson where we talked about the mindset required for the shot put vs. hammer throw, and my article on  rethinking the weight throw. As we entered a new century it had been 30 years since an American woman ranked top 10 in the world. Suzy Powell-Roos led a group of throwers that changed that and put the event on the map globally for the US. On this week's podcast, the 3-time Olympian and former American record holder joins us to look back at her throwing career and look ahead at her coaching career.

The bigger challenge is coordinating the whole body to add speed to the element through elasticity, as well as strength. German national discus coach René Sack joins this week's podcast to discuss how he thinks about this element of the throw and exchange ideas about how to address it in training.

Wenn mir jemand vor 12 Monaten gesagt hätte, dass ich so viel Spaß dabei habe neue Folgen für euch aufzunehmen, dann hätte ich das wahrscheinlich nicht geglaubt. Warum, das verrate ich dir in dieser Folge.
 Doch eigentlich geht es um ein ganz anderes Thema, nämlich deinen Kraftort. Ich ermutige dich dazu: „lass deine Gymnastikmatte dein Kraftort sein“.
 Mal abgesehen von Folge 0, der Introfolge über mich, ist Folge 50 die bisher wahrscheinlich persönlichste, in der ich dir einiges über meine Beziehung zu meiner Gymnastikmatte erzähle und warum sie mir so viel Energie schenkt. 
 Im Podcast spreche ich unter anderem darüber:
 ➡️ Was ist überhaupt ein Kraftort und wie findest du deinen?
 ➡️ Ich verrate dir welcher Ort mein „meditativer“ Kraftort ist (meine Gymnastikmatte ist mein sportlicher Kraftort)
 ➡️ Warum es sinnvoll ist zwei Gymnastikmatten zu haben

Holy Embodied: ein RefLab-Podcast,"Holy Embodied ist ein Podcast, der behauptet: Es ist an der Zeit, den Körper wieder in die Kirchen zu bringen. Oder anders gesagt: Es ist an der Zeit, den Körper als fantastisches Tor zu jeglicher Form von Spiritualität wieder zu entdecken. Gerade in unserer evangelisch-reformierten Tradition, wurde die Form des Menschen lange genug ignoriert und nur auf den Verstand gesetzt. Viele von uns leben ausschliesslich im Kopf, im Denken – und vergessen den Körper, der nicht nur dazu da ist, unsere Gehirne umherzutragen. Wir finden, das reicht jetzt und leuchten aus, wie und warum unsere Körper der einfachste Weg zu Gott sind. Und was es letztlich heisst, „Holy Embodied“ in seiner ganzen Radikalität zu leben. Auf dieser Entdeckungsreise sind wir nicht-konfessionell, interreligiös und undogmatisch unterwegs. Gespräche zwischen Deborah Sutter und Patrick Schwarzenbach, kurze Tutorials zum ganz konkreten Üben und Gäste dienen uns dabei als Pfeiler. Warum Patrick meint, reformierte Pfarrpersonen seien etwas «spassbefreit» und Deborah sich gerne mal auf den Boden legt – hört ihr in dieser dritten Episode. Sie stellen sich die Frage, was sie hier tun – und warum. Dabei spannen sie das Feld weit auf: vom Hören der Predigt bis zum Hören auf die Körper-Signale. Erste geführte Meditationssitzung mit Deborah auf Englisch. Zum Innehalten und Entspannen. Deborah Sutter interviewt Patrick Schwarzenbach. Was versteht er unter ""Ur-Vertrauen""? Wieso glaubt er nicht ausschliesslich an das geschriebene Gotteswort? Welche Grenzen hat die Sprache, wenn es um das Gottesverständnis geht? Und wieso schätzt er christliche Formen der Meditation? Patrick Schwarzenbach befragt in dieser Episode Deborah Sutter. Ist sie gläubig? Was hat sie für ein Gottesverständnis? Was ist ihr heilig? Wie können Meditation und Yoga die Verbindung zum Göttlichen oder Heiligen ermöglichen? Und wann wurde in ihrem Leben die Spiritualität so zentral und wichtig?"

Hospital and Internal Medicine Podcast,"Hospital & Internal Medicine lectures are intended for the medical professional who enjoys learning for the sake of it. Dr. Porat is a practicing Hospitalist and Board Certified in Internal Medicine. Correcting Hypernatremia in adults (finally, a real study!). An option for that scary patient with hemoptysis. How many nephrons you have (and your patient has) - it matters.  Anemia of Inflammation is also often referred to as Anemia of Chronic Disease. It is one of the most common anemias, yet often challenging to comprehend. This is an attempt is to try and simplify it. If you know why red blood cells survive less (and are made less) during inflammatory conditions, and already know why ferritin increases in inflammation, and don't want to hear a lousy Iron Man plot idea - then you are good to go on skipping this episode. It occurs naturally in the body (because we synthesize it), it is in meat, and it is frequently used as a supplement. Since it is in you, why not understand what is and what it does? Advice is provided on which supplement labels to particularly avoid. A brief reflection upon creatine within our brains (and the potential memory impact seen in one study) is utilized to make the point that when it comes to a performance enhancer, like creatine, it's not solely about the ramifications on muscle strength and endurance. The replenishing of muscle ATP is one (of the several) mechanisms that creatine helps with when it comes to heavy anaerobic exercise. Other topics discussed are things to know about lab testing the kidneys while taking creatine. Thoughts on why some don't respond to creatine supplementation."
Hot Iron Experience,"What is one way to give yourself a huge advantage at experiencing success? It could be with your health, your business, your career, school, etc. Strength is in numbers, that is why I started my Facebook Group, Logan's League. I want to help people change the way they look, the way the feel, show them the tools to earn confidence in themselves that others just ""seem to have"". Inside Logan's League I share lessons that I have learned over the past two years that have helped completely change the way I look and feelThere are quarterly challenges that everyone is welcome to participate in and if you're looking for a team environment to help hold yourself accountable, meet others with the same goals as you, and are ready to make a change. This is the group and podcast for you.This podcast will be a more in-depth look at topics I cover within my Facebook group and is a way for me to better educate you on the ""right"" and ""wrong"" things when it comes to getting into the best shape you can. The group is private, but anyone is welcome to join. Just search on Facebook ""Logan's League"", enjoy! I want the group to be a community blog where we can all share things like recipes, exercises, posts of after a workout to help motivate others, what you need help with, and again atcha lol. Don't ignore your grades, BUT don't let them define who you are. Anyways, on this podcast I dive into not focusing on the number that the scale shows. Focusing on my body image and having my ""goal weight"" is the most important to me. I'm back with an episode where I talk about how I make time to workout while still being a full time student. Also, rewarding yourself without food"

In A Skirt Podcast,"In A Skirt Podcast, with host Krystal Riley, introduces the world to the unconventional athlete; the athlete who is breaking stereotypes and bravely celebrating differences. Join us to get to know those who are becoming the heroes and role models we have been waiting for. Each episode will be an interview with a different athlete, coach, race director, entrepreneur, or other individual who is making running and sports accessible and open to everyone, regardless of religion, dress, income, or anything that sets someone apart from the traditional athlete. Community. That’s the word that kept popping into my head when I was talking to Erica Kirkwood. The power of community. The power of encouraging people speaking positivity into a life. A lot of people are strong on their own, but a community can take that strength and turn it into something phenomenal.
 Erica is a talented and hardworking runner. She is also a wife, mother of two, and occupational therapist. And she is also an Olympic Trials qualifier, having broken 2:45 at Grandma’s Marathon last year.
 In this episode, she tells me about every person who has pushed her and encouraged her and helped her along the way. Her community. That, along with her hard work ethic and personal mantra—“Why not me?”—has helped her get faster and faster.
I really think you’re going to love this episode. Erica is inspiring and fun to get to know. Cheer her on in a few weeks as she runs in Atlanta with the best of the best in America at the Olympic Marathon Trials.

  One of my favorite things about this podcast is the opportunity to get to know people. I love the conversations I have on this show and being able to meet my guests and listeners, even if it is just over the phone, Skype, or social media. 
Today’s guest is no exception. I have never met Holly in person, but I feel like we are friends. Some time last year, a woman in my church told me, “You should meet my sister-in-law. You would like her. She’s a runner like you.” After that I became social media friends with the sister-in-law, whose name happened to be Holly. 
I have followed Holly’s journey over the last year while she has run race after race after race. I have been impressed by her hard work and dedication to running, while working full time as a nurse practitioner and also wearing wife and mom hats. 
In this episode, we talk about her job, why she started running, training for six marathons in 12 months, and being part of the skirt-girl tribe.
I hope you enjoy our conversation.

In A Skirt on Twitter This is a special episode for me. Robert and I went to school together. We graduated from Lyford High School in 2001. Go Bulldogs!
Robert signed up for his first 5K in October of 2015. He didn’t know what he was in for, but after that first event, he was hooked. 
This past year, as his mother’s health declined, he promised her he would run 12 5Ks in 2019 for her. He kept his promise, even though it ended up being a difficult and emotional year for Robert and his family.
In this episode, Robert tells me about his favorite 5Ks and opens up about the trying year his family has had.

Originally based off of an idea I saw on a social media post by TobyMac, I searched Scripture for examples of how the Lord has provided on our behalf. 

Using those examples plus Psalm 40:1-3, I pray this episode encourages you to wait in HOPE and EXPECTATION.  Grab a journal and a quiet spot...or just push play to find some calm in the middle of your crazy ;)

In My Whey Podcast,"In My Whey Podcast is hosted by me, Brian Geller, DC, a chiropractor out of Buffalo, NY. Originally started as a fanzine in the summer of 2011, In My Whey was created to capture all things strength in the hardcore/punk community. The fanzine embodied the DIY movement by self-publishing, editing and funding the entire project, with no ads nor sponsors. In My Whey Fanzine featured a wide range of interviews with people ranging from elite-level powerlifters, strength coaches, recreational lifters, musicians in touring bands to diet advice, steroids, music and more. After publishing 2 volumes of In My Whey Fanzine, I decided to take a break from zines and focus on school...8 years later and I started up my first podcast: 'Doctor Oblivious; A Podcast Idiot', publishing 6 episodes in 2019. While I was happy with the progress I was making, I wasn't really satisfied with it, feeling as if I pigeon-holed myself to a certain standard of who I should interview or what I should be talking about. I wanted to make a change.Fast forward to 2020 and I am taking a new direction with the podcast: In My Whey Podcast. Continuing off the roots that was In My Whey Fanzine, a DIY podcast with hardcore/punk drive, a doctorate level education and just enough money to buy the cheapest microphones. WELCOME BACK TO IN MY WHEY PODCAST, FORMERLY DR. OBLIVIOUS


Why the name change? Didn't like it anymore - honestly, never did like it to begin with. 


In 2011 I published my first zine: #InMyWheyFanzine. I put everything I had into this zine and my goal was to keep it true to the hardcore/DIY mentality. It was self-published, self-funded and edited by a friend. All the interviews were conducted by me during that summer - the same summer I was in an intensive gross anatomy course. I had no intentions with this zine other than to showcase lifters in the hardcore/punk community. At that time, lifting and hardcore was all I knew, all I cared about and spoke about. This was just an easy way to get all that s**t out of my head and onto paper. I sold out 2 presses of 50 copies each before the end of that summer. In 2012, I released the second volume, and last volume. You can find the download links at: linktr.ee/briangellerdc

What to expect with the new podcast? Not much else besides more interviews and better sound quality. 


Today's episode is with old friend and previous guest, Carley Skarupinski of Mustache Fitness &amp; Barbell in Buffalo, NY. We talk about LGBT powerlifting, supertotals, programming and recovery, plus a lot more fun stuff.

In The Box Cast,"O In The Box é um podcast destinado à comunidade do CrossFit! Com dicas, entrevistas, curiosidades e muitas informações, traz uma linguagem leve, divertida e didática pra você, que ama ou está aprendendo a amar o CrossFit. Esse podcast é produzido pela CrossFit Saurus, que tem 3 unidades em SP: Vila Guilherme, Bosque Maia e Pompeia. Pull-ups, Chest to Bar, Bar Muscle Up, Handstand Walk, Rope Climb e muitos outros nomes que a princípio parecem complicados demais. Esses são alguns dos movimentos ginásticos realizados nos box de CrossFit do mundo inteiro.

Mas essa nem sempre é uma técnica tão apreciada por alguns atletas. Então neste episódio, Julio Sena e o Coach Henrique Barros falam sobre a ginástica nossa de cada dia. O que são esses movimentos? Como realizar? Como não realizar? E muito mais! Se você ainda não segue a gente no Instagram, corre lá e procura @intheboxcast. Só treinar não basta pra ter um corpo saudável. Mas só comer bem também não! A junção dessas duas atividades tão fundamentais pra nossa vida com mais algumas coisas é o que traz equilíbrio pra qualquer pessoa.
Julio Sena entrevista no In The Box Cast de hoje duas pessoas especiais da CrossFit Saurus: Maria Clara e Jéssica Mascaretti. As duas já participaram de episódios anteriores e agora juntaram forças pra falar com a gente sobre um programa de dieta e treinamentos exclusivo que acontece na CrossFit Saurus, o FitRex! Festas de confraternização da empresa, ceia de Natal, encontro com  amigos da infância, jantar de ano novo, fora os aniversários e  casamentos, que não param no fim de ano.
Tantas oportunidades  de... comer! E claro que a maioria das pessoas acaba comendo mais do que  deveria. Mas treinar que é bom... nem sempre rola!
No episódio  de hoje, Julio Sena e Henrique Barros falam sobre como voltar ao seu ritmo de treinos no  CrossFit depois das festas de fim de ano. Será que é possível sobreviver  a esse período sem muitos danos? E quando a preguiça bate e você começa  a cogitar esperar o Carnaval pra voltar aos treinos?

Se você curtiu esse episódio manda um alô pra gente lá o Instagram @intheboxcast! Todo final de ano a CrossFit Saurus realiza o Murph, um dos Heroes da CrossFit. Julio Sena conversou com alguns atletas que participaram da edição 2019 dessa confraternização e cobriu o antes e depois do Murph. Se você curtiu esse episódio, manda um feedback pra gente lá no Instagram @intheboxcast! O Open 2020 veio como uma novidade e agora já está quase acabando. Como estão sendo os WODs? Seria esse o Open mais inclusivo já feito? E como será a preparação para o Open 2021?

Além disso, neste episódio eu, Julio Sena, e o Coach Henrique Barros vamos falar sobre o limiar aeróbico e anaeróbico, ATP, VO2 e um monte de siglas e nomes difíceis que vão ficar mais fáceis de você entender e aplicar nos seus treinos. Ele ainda trouxe dicas de como usar seu smartwatch nos treinos para melhorar sua perfomance e conhecer seus limites.

Se você curtiu esse episódio manda um alô pra gente lá o Instagram @intheboxcast! Você imagina como é estar dentro da arena no CrossFit Games? O casal sensação da CrossFit Saurus esteve lá e traz pra gente nesse episódio algumas curiosidades sobre o Games 19, os perrengues da viagem e como foi estar ao lado dos maiores atletas do mundo. 

Além disso, aproveitei a presença deles pra falar sobre o Open 2020. Pela primeira vez teremos duas edições do Open no mesmo ano é isso tem gerado muitas polêmicas e debates dentro da comunidade do CrossFit. 

Se você ainda não segue o In The Box Cast no Instagram, corre lá! É só procurar o @intheboxcast.

In The Flow,"Sports nutritionist and endurance coach Jackson Long finds flow through conversations on evidence-based nutrition education for athletes, plant-based diets, meditation, exercise science, the flow state, and beyond to fuel bodies, minds, and adventure through good food and meaningful movement. Jackson holds a bachelor's degree in Integrative Physiology and a master's degree in Applied Nutrition. This week on the show I sit down with Lizzie Larkins, a senior on the University of Vermont nordic ski team to chat about the lifestyle of a nordic skier and the lessons she’s learned going through some periods of overtraining and underfueling and how she now applies her studies as a nutrition major to training and racing. We also discuss RED-S in the nordic community, her favorite foods, finding a balance with social media, and plenty more.
 This is a fantastic conversation for any young athlete hoping to continue in their career into the collegiate ranks. A 3 time All-American at Junior Nationals, member of the UVM NCAA Ski National Championships squad, and nutrition nerd, Lizzie offers some sage wisdom and advice on keeping things in perspective and fueling the love of sport that is so important to cultivate. I sit down with performance nutritionist and climbing nutrition specialist, Tom Herbert for a conversation ranging from nutritional considerations for climbers, to addressing RED-S in the climbing community, myth busting specific nutrients for athletes, and differing perspectives on plant based nutrition. To learn more about Tom, visit useful.coach.  I reflect on 2019 and discuss what I'm looking forward to in 2020, and what to expect with the show in the new year.  I sit down with my dear friend, Abby Mickey for a candid conversation on life as a professional cyclist, her struggles through a tumultuous career, nutrition, and what life now looks like after transitioning out of professional sports. For more on Abby, check out Freewheeling, the new podcast from the CyclingTips network:  https://cyclingtips.com/2019/12/introducing-freewheeling-a-new-podcast-with-abby-mickey/ This week I bring you all a conversation with an amazing athlete and human, Sonya Looney. For the unfamiliar, Sonya is a professional mountain biker who has an impressive palmares in ultra-distance races including winning the world championships in the 24-hr distance in 2015 and crushing it all over the globe from Mongolia to South Africa. She is now a fellow podcaster, renowned speaker, author, and figure in the sport mindset and performance world and just has a lot of really great stuff to say. I first met Sonya for a podcast a few years ago on Thought For Food, so I wanted to catch up again and nerd out on themes that we both really care about like meditation for athletes, the purpose of the flow state, plant-based nutrition, relationship with food, and more. Learn all about Sonya at sonyalooney.com.  As athletes, we often ride that very fine line between maintaining and over reaching in training and balancing all the other things we have going on in our lives. As such, it's useful to learn to listen to our bodies while also monitoring and measuring critical nutrients like iron and vitamin D, and understanding what too much exercise looks like. This week on the show, I sit down with naturopathic physician and master's cyclist Dr. Steve Parcell to chat critical nutrients for athletes, considerations for older athletes, and the consequences of too much exercise. You can learn more about what Dr. Parcell is up to at https://www.naturemedclinic.com/. "

In-Tension,"Roy and Jen will talk training, nutrition, mental health, relationships, time management and more in short episodes where listener questions will also be answered. In episode 8, Roy and Jen briefly discuss their own training and endeavors, before diving into how to choose the right gym for you and answering listener questions. In this episode, Jen and Roy briefly share what’s going on in their lives- before discussing their own efforts and what the research says about building habits and bulking. In this episode, Jen and Roy mess up a lot but do their best in discussing caffeine intake, supplementation for athletes and non-athletes, and answering listener questions. In this episode, Jen and Roy talk about unconventional/functional fitness and activity, dealing with injuries physically and mentally, and answer some Q’s regarding training and nonsense. This episode centers mostly around Bud’s journey in the gym, but we also touch on what the gym has done for him as a person and how it has taught him to be better in other facets of life. *disclaimer: touches briefly and generally on addiction* In episode 2 we touch on updates in our lives and with the business, mental health considerations when engaging in physical activity, and we finish up by answering listener questions"

InDurance,"The InDurance podcast is a monthly episode dedicated to endurance athlete health and resilience.  We pick apart and nail down those factors that make an athlete healthy and vibrant by inspection of the latest in sports healthcare, sports medicine, and sports science. We regularly invite expert guests who are champions in their field whether track side or behind the scenes of. We encourage them to  reveal more about the specifics in the world of sports health and medicine that assist athletes to be the healthiest they can be and underpin optimisation performance outcomes and maximize potential. We believe that success in sport is all about keeping the athlete's engine management system well maintained and components ready for action, but most importantly its about keeping them healthy, purposeful and fast. The episodes are specifically produced for professionals who work in sport health but also for endurance athletes to create citizen level scientists and grow a wealth of knowledge to benefit their very own personal sports medicine and  sports nutrition….whatever their sport…. Endurance training and racing is as big as its ever been….. so secure and safeguard your performance and health. InDurance are experts in blood profiling knowledge and technology as well as providing athletes with precision athlete healthcare. We are a team of sports medics, nutritionists, sport scientists and psychologists who assist athletes to deconstruct and discover their inner athlete thereby fulfilling human performance potential and true greatness in the sport they love. Episode 3 is an interview type format and we are talking with Lee Piercy, a home grown but US based duathlete who is know as the athlete who has won more than 100 duathlons and several successive national titles. He has achieved phenomenal success having been at the pinnacle of the sport for 17 years when it first began as very much a fringe sport.
Since moving out to California in early 2015 it has been a fantastic season  having won a bronze medal in the World Duathlon Champs, Bronze in the Powerman USA pro race and won Powerman Arizona earlier this year. Lee has achieved this success following a pragmatic but structured recovery from chronic fatigue based health issues despite  the odds of never reaching pre-illness levels of form, and in fact has surpassed and exceeded those expectations prior , and this is the main reason we are so keen to capture some insights from Lee’s career and recovery. Lee has been a frequent user of blood profiling and testing particularly at InDurance in order to monitor his own recovery and optimisation of nutrition  and rest, and has been experiencing the benefits and insights for many years before this became a mainstream health tool.
The interview is a wonderful insight in what its like to be a professional level AG athlete, and a real masterclass in how to manage a high pressure job, ward off illness and exhaustion and be great father and husband too. Lee is a fascinating and articulate speaker and clearly demonstrates his intelligence on smart training, rest and diet - nevertheless the interview throws up also many surprises and revelations and i believe this will be something very fascinating to athletes and health conscious listeners who can be confident they can aim for success and achieve goals but a modest volume of intelligent training, structured rest and high quality nutrition. On todays episode we are pleased to present a multiple scientific article review or 'Journal club' which may be featured again as an ongoing format within the InDurance Podcast structure. We are discussing recent developments and interest in alternative fuel substrates for sports health and performance, in particular recent interest in low carbohydrate feeding for athletes. We look at some of the data and stories so far on the subject to raise further awareness and dertmine whether this recent trend of restricted fuel intake has any real merit to it. To build on this we are also going to inspect some of the evidence which has uncovered some concerns about high carbohydrate feeding in endurance sports and debate its value. We will look at two very important scientific papers that have appeared over the last few years which provide some.....food for thought! On todays pilot episode our presenter Dr Will Mangar discusses the Theory Of State Of Flow with Ultra-runner Jane Holt. Many endurance athletes we have spoken to describe such a sensation after benchmark training sessions and landmark races  having moved to that higher level of performance. Athletes have described Flow as a sense of control and  total immersion in an activity to the extent that time appears to slow down or speed up in some cases! We also discuss the hot topic Exercise Induced Hyponatraemia and salt balance in long distance racing with polar explorer, ultra runner and student doctor Ollie Stoten. This condition has shaken the endurance sport sphere following a number of high profile incidents and deaths within long distance events"

Inspired Intentions Podcast,"Are you are too busy, stuck in a rut, or not taking care of yourself? You deserve better. It’s time to create awareness, find new courage, and build your confidence. The Inspired Intentions podcast from Skyterra Wellness Retreat will help you move towards change in your life for the better.Join us every week as we simplify the world of healthy living with conversations about fitness, nutrition, yoga, stress management, recreation and adventure. We cut through through the unrealistic noise on diets and fitness, and show you how healthy living fits seamlessly into your already busy life. New episodes out every Monday. Nothing changes when it comes to the amount of adventure in Western North Carolina during the winter. We have access to spectacular trails, waterfalls and streams, many of them on campus or a short drive away.







Here at Skyterra, we all love the opportunity to share a breathtaking perspective of our beautiful state and how everything changes during our winter season. On this episode, we speak with Alan Broyhill, Skyterra’s Recreation Lead, on all the benefits of getting outdoors in the winter, no matter where you live.







Read Alan’s blog, an ode to winter, here. You’ve tried diet after diet. You’re confused on what and how to eat. You’re sick of feeling like a failure. But guess what! You didn’t fail. You are not a failure. The diets have failed you. 







On today’s episode with special guest Lindsay Ford, Lead Dietitian at Skyterra, we discuss why diets don’t work, and how to ditch the diet mentality for good. Each year around New Year’s resolution time, we reflect on the past and hope that this year will be the year to get organized, lose weight, quit smoking, or spend more time with family. Every time we set a new goal — and preferably a small goal — it gives us a chance to build confidence and belief that a new normal is possible. But to get after your new normal, thinking differently is required. 







Join us as we discuss resolutions, what can get in the way, and how to focus on goals — and not outcomes — to finally make your resolution happen.

Host Fred Fishkin asks about PFB’s advocacy at the local, state, and national levels, its city rideability rankings, and its retailer-facing initiatives that are designed to get more people riding. With less than a week to go before Interbike Marketweek 2018, Jenn shares details of the content that PFB will present at the popular Interbike Industry Breakfast, which includes moderating a panel about increasing ridership among kids and adults and introducing its newest program, Ride Spot. Exploring “The Connected Bike” and Opportunities for Retailers
The convergence of consumer technology and cycling isn’t new, but its relevance is growing in leaps and bounds as bikes and riders become more digitally connected.
In the twelfth episode of Interbike - The Podcast, host Fred Fishkin explores the concept of “The Connected Bike”, what it means for retailers, and what’s on the horizon in terms of new products that will be on display at Interbike next month. From power meters to Zwift, and heart rate monitors to Strava, technology, apps, and software have become ubiquitous in cycling. Fred and his co-host, Steve Frothingham of Bicycle Retailer and Industry News, interview Stacy Perlis of Wahoo Fitness and Russ Johnston of Pioneer, two companies that are at the forefront of integrating bicycles and technology. In addition to discussing the current landscape and market trends, the group talks about how retailers can take a key role in the trend toward connectivity. As September approaches, retailers and suppliers in the  bike industry prepare for Interbike, which starts a new chapter in Reno-Tahoe this year.
In the eleventh episode of Interbike - The Podcast, host Fred Fishkin interviews Justin Gottlieb, Interbike show director, as he and his team put the finishing touches on the 2018 edition of North America’s largest bicycle industry trade show. Interbike announced its decision to move to Reno-Tahoe just one year ago, and Justin describes the changes that are in store for 2018. From arrival in a city that’s eager to welcome the industry, to the NorthStar Free-Ride Festival on the opening weekend...from industry group rides, to an OutDoor Demo on world-class trails...from a thoughtfully curated series of educational tracks to unequaled face-to-face interaction on the show floor...it’s shaping up to be a phenomenal show.

IPNOSI la conoscenza che ti fa scegliere,"Una versione dell’ipnosi che parla di conoscenza, quella personale che rende consapevoli delle proprie intenzioni e delle possibilità. Se siamo la storia che ci raccontiamo, allora può essere utile riconoscere nuovi elementi che ne arricchiscano la narrazione: l’immaginazione si fa interprete del pensiero per esprimere una realtà possibile, le sensazioni rafforzano la volontà che rende manifesta la decisione. Ne emerge una logica personale che aiuta a scegliere, individua la direzione, corregge il percorso verso una migliore organizzazione dell’esistenza, che qualcuno chiama cambiamento. Ho raccontato teorie e considerazioni ricavate dalla mia esperienza, mescolato fonti che hanno agito diversi apprendimenti e prodotto altre considerazioni ma, come ho già detto, le teorie si adattano a quello che si intende dimostrare.
Per questo amo l’ipnosi, manifestazione concreta del pensiero, dimostrazione pratica dell’intenzione, sa esprimere la nostra impegnativa originalità.
La trance si modella con la materia presente al momento, assecondando intuizioni, tenendo presente una richiesta di partenza o godendosi semplicemente l’esplorazione, attraverso stati mentali che ci portino oltre la realtà immediatamente circostante.
Un desiderio di trascendenza che ci aiuti a guardare più lontano, a pensare di poterci spingere al di là dei limiti che crediamo di avere. Se è lecito domandarsi da dove arrivino certe intuizioni o perché emergano determinati ricordi anziché altri all’interno di un generico stato di trance, gli interrogativi con i quali si cerca di dare un senso all’esperienza di un’ipotetica altra vita spaziano senza confini tra teorie e religioni. La trance della quale qui si parla è uno stato di ricerca consapevole, tanto più efficace quanto bene guidato. Si può essere buoni conduttori di se stessi ma se accompagnati da qualcuno l’esplorazione ha la possibilità di essere più ampia, in un’alternanza di suggerimenti e stimoli che arricchiscano uno spazio mentale condiviso.
Si racconta di un orso polare rinchiuso in una gabbia provvisoria all'interno di uno zoo, attorno alla quale venne costruito un ambiente pseudo naturale dal confine più ampio. Quando la gabbia fu smontata, l'orso continuò a muoversi entro lo stretto spazio concesso dai limiti precedenti. Anche l'essere umano a volte ignora la propria libertà creativa che gli consentirebbe di avere nuove prospettive.
La trance è un’esperienza mentale, ossia un’elaborazione di ciò che attraverso i sensi possiamo percepire, ed è necessario quindi tenere presente che ognuno percepisce ed elabora in modo del tutto personalizzato. Immagino l’inconscio come l’autofocus di una macchina fotografica progettata con la tecnologia fuzzy, quella che utilizza dati ambigui tra il completamente falso ed il completamente vero, come abbastanza, quasi o un poco, riuscendo a realizzare operazioni estremamente sofisticate attraverso processi molto semplici: centra la scena, in base all’inquadratura stabilisce quale sia l’elemento importante da porre in primo piano, sceglie la giusta esposizione di luce per rendere al meglio la qualità dell’immagine ed è pronta per lo scatto. Diversi modi di narrare la storia personale, per fare della propria vita un parco giochi anziché un campo di battaglia. Trance e costruttivismo, poiché la realtà è una costruzione personale."

Mal miteinander, mal aneinander vorbei und mal mit Experten.Stay hungry, stay tuned. Stefanie und Alex finden, dass Podcasts zwei sehr positive Aspekte haben, die sie diesmal auch praktisch vermitteln wollen. Es geht um aktiv und passiv. Ausgelobt im Übrigen der deutschsprachige dysphagiologische Podcast Contest 2020! Das Jahr 2020 verspricht aus dysphagiologischer Sicht spannend zu werden. Allerdings setzt das viel Arbeit voraus: an sich selbst aber auch politisch muss sich was bewegen. Über die EBP muss man allein schon deswegen reden, weil evidenzbasiertes Handeln auch für Praxen wichtig ist. Die Hürden sind hier andere. Die Grundausbildung im Bereich der Logopädie unterscheidet sich formal schon sehr zwischen Deutschland und Österreich. Aber beiden Arten gemein ist, dass die Dysphagie eigentlich zu kurz kommt. Ob das so ist und was man für Möglichkeiten hat, besprechen Alex und Simon Sollereder in diesem Sommertalk. Stefanie und Alex unterhalten sich über Tagungen in Japan und Wien und eine Tagung in Essen. Es geht auch um Physiologie. Stefanie im Sommertalk mit Prof. Daniels (featuring Petra Puschinski) über Screenings, Diagnostik, Assesments und Ice Creme."

 Facebook  For Hayley, success isn’t about the number of clients she has. (For the record, she has six and isn’t trying to get more.)
  
 Success is about balance, staying active in the industry while still making time for her toddler (and another one on the way!). It’s about earning money and spending QT with her husband, who holds down a civilian job while also serving in the National Guard. It’s about taking care of herself and avoiding burnout.

It's Your Health with Lisa Davis,"THIS SHOW IS THE CONTINUATION OF TALK HEALTHY TODAY PODCAST.  IF YOU WANT TO HEAR MORE OF TALK HEALTHY TODAY, this is the podcast for you! This podcast is about inspiring healthy lifestyle change. Every episode provides tips and tools on how to strengthen your resolve to make lasting change. The advice that’s given on every episode is designed to help you improve your health: physically, emotionally, and more!~ Kombucha is everywhere, and its fan base is growing rapidly, with sales estimated to grow to $1.8 billion by 2020.Its high levels of probiotics and antioxidants make it a healthy alternative to soda, with numerous benefits for digestion, mood, immune function, and weight regulation.The challenge is that kombucha is expensive, and its healthful qualities can be mitigated by the inclusion of excess sugar.Now, health seekers are taking matters into their own hands. More and more people are fermenting their own kombucha at home. Not only is it easy and fun to customize healthy flavors, it’s remarkably cost-effective at just 50¢ per gallon (that’s eight store-bought bottles) versus a whopping $3–$5 per 16 ounce bottle at the grocery store.Lila Volkas is a certified Nutrition Consultant and received her education from Bauman College: Holistic Nutrition (https://www.baumancollege.org/) in Berkeley, CA. She was inspired to follow this path by her own four-year healing journey from chronic skin, digestive and fatigue issues. 
She has come to recognize the onset of these health challenges as a blessing in disguise. They strengthened her ability to listen and attune to her body's needs and led Lila to her dream job of helping others find healing through food. 






















ABOUT BAUMAN COLLEGEEstablished in 1989, Bauman College is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that educates future leaders, thinkers, and creators in the holistic nutrition and culinary arts professions to support people in achieving optimal health. Bauman College’s philosophy centers around the Eating for Health® model developed by Dr. Ed Bauman. This model is a whole-foods approach based on seasonal, organic, unprocessed, and local foods. Within this framework, David Foreman, widely known as ""the herbal pharmacist,” discusses a very prominent health issue: muscle loss.

It’s a loss everyone starts to experience after their 30th birthday, but few people start to feel by age 50. Researchers are now stressing that sarcopenia is not just associated with frailty and appearance resulting from age-related muscle loss, but it’s also the key component behind chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer.

 David Foreman says people who have more muscle mass just live longer because, quite simply, they can combat disease. The primary problem with age-related muscle degeneration is that other than recommending resistance training, which people often don’t do, there is no pharmaceutical treatment to reverse muscle loss. Foreman, however is hopeful and says the landscape for sarcopenia is changing with new science emerging to give people preventative tools they need to delay and reverse muscle loss at any age. He will share with your audience three rejuvenating muscle moves you can make to stave off sarcopenia and regain control of potentially life-threatening diseases that are influenced by lack of muscle (talking points include: powering up with plant-based proteins: peanuts, almonds, edamame, chickpeas, spirulina, essential amino acids needed for muscle maintenance and growth especially if you are on a plant-based, vegan/vegetarian diet and the most productive muscle workouts in the gym).
David Foreman, revered as “The Herbal Pharmacist,” started his career as a registered pharmacist and now uses his expertise in physiology, pharmacology and integrative medicine to educate consumers on cutting edge approaches to natural health and healing.

I always wanted a big brother.  Being the oldest, I had to learn most things the hard way.  I always had some level of envy that my little brother had me to lean on for advice.  I a... Adversity is an irreducible fact of life.  Although we can and should learn from all experiences, both positive and negative, bestselling author Dr. Norman E. Rosenthal, believes that adversity is by far the best teacher most of us will ever encounter.Whether the adversity one experiences is the result of poor decision-making, a desire to test one’s mettle, or plain bad luck, Rosenthal believes life’s most important lessons—from the value of family to the importance of occasionally cutting corners—can be best learned from it.Running counter to society’s current prevailing message that “excellence” must always be aspired to, and failure or mistakes of any sort are to be avoided at all costs, Rosenthal shows that engaging with our own failures and defeats is one of the only ways we are able to live authentic and meaningful lives, and that each different type of adversity carries its own challenges and has the potential to yield its own form of wisdom. Using stories from his own life—including his childhood in apartheid-era South Africa, his years after suffering a violent attack from a stranger, and his career as a psychiatrist—as well as case studies and discussions with well-known figures like Viktor Frankl and David Lynch, Rosenthal shows that true innovation, emotional resilience, wisdom, and dignity can only come from confronting and understanding the adversity we have experienced. Even when life is hardest, there are meanings to be found, riches to be harvested, and gifts that can last a lifetime. Rosenthal illustrates his message through a series of compact, memorable chapters, each one drawn from episodes in the lives of his patients, colleagues, or himself, and concluded with a take-away maxim on the lesson learned. Stop f’ing around with your health... ...and take control of your life! Sick of being overweight, diabetic, or achy and low energy? Tired of being fatigued or depressed? Sick and tired of taking multiple prescription drugs with no end in sight? There is another way to live—not just to feel a little better or take fewer drugs, but to strut through life feeling your best.Is there a catch? You bet! You’ll have to take a radical look at what you eat, get rid of the junk and replace it with fresh whole foods... but it all starts in your head. Along the way you’ll learn to detoxify your attitude too. You gotta really want to be healthy! Rebel physician Roberto Tostado envisions a new direction in medicine, integrating whole-foods nutrition, thinking less toxic thoughts, and releasing ourselves from grudges and self-loathing. This is the new direction that he truly believes will help prevent most chronic diseases while smiling all the way. Rich Karlgaard is the publisher of Forbes magazine and is based in Silicon Valley. He is a renown lecturer, pilot, and the author of four acclaimed previous books.
Here is the description of his book, ""Late Bloomers: The Power of Patience in a World Obsessed with Early Achievement."" 
We live in a society where kids and parents are obsessed with early achievement, from getting perfect scores on SATs to getting into Ivy League colleges to landing an amazing job at Google or Facebook—or even better, creating a start-up with the potential to be the next Google or Facebook or Uber. We see software coders become millionaires or billionaires before age thirty and feel we are failing if we are not one of them. Late bloomers, on the other hand, are under - valued—in popular culture, by educators and employers, and even unwittingly by parents. Yet the fact is, a lot of us—most of us—do not explode out of the gates in life. We have to discover our passions and talents and gifts. That was true for author Rich Karlgaard, who had a mediocre academic career at Stanford (which he got into by a fluke) and, after graduating, worked as a dish - washer and nightwatchman before finally finding the inner motivation and drive that ultimately led him to start up a high-tech magazine in Silicon Valley, and eventually to become the publisher of Forbes magazine. There is a scientific explanation for why so many of us bloom later in life. The executive function of our brains doesn’t mature until age twenty-five—and later for some. In fact, our brain’s capabilities peak at different ages. We actually experience multiple periods of blooming in our lives. Moreover, late bloomers enjoy hid - den strengths due to taking the time to discover their way in life—strengths coveted by many em - ployers and partners, including curiosity, insight, compassion, resilience, and wisdom. Based on years of research, personal experience, interviews with neuroscientists, psychologists, and countless people at different stages of their careers, Late Bloomers reveals how and when we achieve our full potential—and why today’s focus on early success is so misguided, and even harmful."

49: Late Bloomers and Slowing Down
In episode 49 I talk about the book Late Bloomers by Rich Karlgaard. Here is the description of the book:
“We live in a society where kids and parents are obsessed with early achievement, from getting perfect scores on SATs to getting into Ivy League colleges to landing an amazing job at Google or Facebook—or even better, creating a start-up with the potential to be the next Google or Facebook or Uber.

Just Fly Performance Podcast,"The Just Fly Performance Podcast is dedicated to all aspects of athletic performance training, with an emphasis on speed and power development. Featured on the show are coaches and experts in the spectrum of sport performance, ranging from strength and conditioning, to track and field, to sport psychology. Hosted by Joel Smith, the Just Fly Performance Podcast brings you some of the best information on modern athletic performance available. Today’s episode is a question and answer session where I take a break from the typical interview format and reflect on listener questions.  I always enjoy doing these shows, since it’s great to get a pulse on what training topics are on the mind of the coaching community. 



For this show, the particular focus was questions on sprinting and sprint training, as well as a lot of ideas on jumping in conjunction with foot strength.  We also touched on a lot of physical preparation principles, such as correction of asymmetry and how I’ve changed my philosophy in working with team sport athletes over time.



Today’s episode is brought to you by SimpliFaster, supplier of high-end athletic development tools, such as the Freelap timing system, kBox, Sprint 1080, and more.



More show notes at just-fly-sports.com/podcast-186-joel-smith/ Today’s episode features András Hegyi, a final-stage Ph.D. student working at the Neuromuscular Research Center at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland.  His Ph.D. work focuses on regional and inter-muscular hamstrings EMG activity in different hamstring exercises and in running.  Hegyi is interested in improving biomechanical methodologies to assess hamstrings to further understand hamstring muscle function and injury mechanisms.



We’ve done some great episodes on hamstring injury prevention in the past, such as episode 161 with Jake Schuster and 158 with JB Morin.  This show is another fantastic addition to that series as András is a wealth of knowledge on the topic, being well versed on what the research yields in regards to many aspects of training and hamstring development, as well as what is functionally asked of the hamstrings in sprinting and sport.



When it comes to hamstrings and injury prevention, a common question is: “What exercises should I do in the gym to help this process”?  An important aspect of the gym and sprinting is that the way these elements “hit the hamstrings” is quite different.  It is important to know what we can, and can’t do in the weightroom to create robust athletes. 



In this episode, András goes into hamstring strain mechanisms, Nordic hamstrings and variations, different gym exercises that hit different aspects of the hamstring musculature, sprinting and it’s role in injury prevention.  He also shares his thoughts on training the adductor magnus as a synergist of the hamstring.  Another important point covered is the importance of individual muscle activation differences in sprinting versus what we see in the gym, which has big implications on how we are training and assessing athletes.

View more show notes at just-fly-sports.com/podcast-185-andras-hegyi/ Today’s episode features gym owner and sports performance coach Mike Kozak and physical therapist, Stephen Laflamme.  



Mike Kozak is the Owner of SOAR Fitness in Columbus, Ohio.  He has trained hundreds of youth athletes as well as a number of current and prospective college and pro athletes. Mike has previously worked as a physical education teacher and youth basketball coach.  He frequently hosts “Rewire” clinics with Adarian Barr and is a fervent student of biomechanics and cutting edge sports performance techniques. He has written several articles for Just Fly Sports.



Stephen Laflamme attained his clinical Doctorate of Physical Therapy from The Ohio State University in 2016 and graduated from the University of Maine in 2012 with a Bachelor's Degree in Exercise Science; also attaining his Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist Certification.  Stephen competed twice in the Arnold Weightlifting Championships and qualified for the 2015 National University Championship in weightlifting. Stephen has traveled the country to be a part of the nation's best educational programs and learn from the nation's best professionals.



When it comes to things like bilateral and single leg squatting, everyone tends to have their own favorite variations, but how often do we think about exactly why we are performing a front, Zercher or RFE split squat?  Are we prescribing these exercises based on what other coaches are utilizing, or based on the individual characteristics and needs of our athletes? In today’s episode Mike and Stephen get into both general and specific principles in catering to athletes optimally in these basic strength movements. 



We had a great recent episode with Justin Moore in episode 176 talking about “knees in” from a holistic perspective, getting into the hydraulics of the body and the pelvic floor.  In this episode we continue in that vein, and get particularly into this dynamic in squatting, landing and jumping, and the differences that exist here, as well as practical training ramifications.  Finally, Mike and Stephen talk about training the foot, as well as integrating some concepts learned from Adarian Barr.

More show notes at just-fly-sports.com/podcast184-kozak-and-laflamme/ Today’s episode features Dr. Nick Serio.  Nick received his doctorate of education in sport and performance psychology from the University of Western States.  He is the co-owner and general manager of the “Athlete’s Warehouse” located in Pleasantville, New York. Nick also serves as the head pitching coach at Fox Lane high school, where the baseball team has had tremendous success.  



I watched Nick’s presentation on medicine ball training he did at the NISMAT symposium, which was a phenomenal and creative demonstration of special strength training for pitchers.  Nick’s work is the epitome of the full-spectrum blend of knowledge of sport specific skill needs, appropriate special strength exercises, as well as solid general strength principles.   



Nick’s special strength medicine ball programming is facilitating significant increases in players throwing speeds, all while keeping their arms healthy, as they avoid throwing baseballs year round (a huge factor in getting injured or burning out early).  Despite the impressive results he gets, Nick is a very honest and transparent individual, as he also indicates the many other training modalities the players are doing (plyometrics, resistance training) as well as simply growing and maturing. Regardless, Nick’s creative solutions to training are something special to learn about, and have ramifications for all throwing athletes, and rotational sports.



On the show today, Nick goes into the factors contributing to the massive injury increases in baseball, and how his medicine ball program can help combat this.  He also chats about general principles in training throwers, postural issues, and then gets into the fine points of his medicine ball training program. Nick also addresses the action of the front block leg in throwing, which is a universal principle, applicable to a great variety of rotational sports. 



Today’s episode is brought to you by SimpliFaster.com, supplier of high-end athletic development tools, such as the Freelap timing system, kBox, Sprint 1080, and more.  Today’s episode features John Garrish, director of athletic development &amp; performance at North Broward Preparatory School in Coconut Creek, Florida, and the school’s head track and field coach.  John has previously served as the Director of Athletic Performance with the Florida Rugby Union’s High-Performance Program 7’s team, and has been involved in numerous other strength and sport coaching roles. He also serves as the National High School Strength Coaches Association Regional Board Member for the Southeast.



John is a passionate, creative and detail oriented coach, who distributes his methods freely through his social media outlets.  At North Broward prep, John has the challenges of teaching speed and athletic movement to large groups of athletes at a time.  In doing so, he has implemented a variety of unique mini-hurdle variations with arm position, as well as hand and finger positioning, these each having unique impacts on the athletes.  John is a tremendous compiler of data and sprint images, and it was a joy to pick his brain on his speed training implementation and discoveries.



On the show today, John covers his management of the weight room as North Broward and how he manages large groups of athletes with a small support staff.  He describes his use of gallops and various skips as an important part of his warm-up process, and then gets into all of the mini-hurdle speed constraints in his program, which is a true highlight.   This was a fantastic episode on speed training for not just the high school athlete, but any athlete seeking improved speed and explosive ability.

View more show notes at just-fly-sports.com/podcast-182-john-garrish/ Today’s episode features Tyler Yearby and Michael Zweifel.



Tyler Yearby is a Former Strength &amp; Conditioning Coach at Northeastern State University and the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities who has delivered over 200 domestic &amp; international continuing education courses, workshops, and conference presentations in 12 countries.  Tyler has, and continues to work with athletes ranging from youth to professional.  Michael Zweifel is the owner and head of sports performance for “Building Better Athletes” performance center in Dubuque, Iowa.  Michael has been on a number of previous Just Fly Performance Podcast episodes, focusing largely on the development of reactive agility and transferable sport movement.  Tyler and Michael are both a part of “Emergence” which is a movement skill education company.



When it comes to building athletes in the agility and change of direction space, attitudes are changing and coaches are realizing how important it is to teach perception and decision making in a variety of situations, to eventually transfer better to sport.  Agility done for the sake of running through cones as fast as possible is very limited in what it can do for an athlete in a chaotic sport environment, and podcast #76 was the epitome of that information.



Today’s show takes those same ideas of reactivity and creative movement, and puts it into the structure of the weight room: resistance training and plyometric exercises.  Tyler and Michael try to mirror their approach to an “athlete based” model of problem solving throughout an entire program, and in this episode they share how creative means are utilized in the weight room to not only improve movement and robustness, but also stoke the fires of athlete creativity.  On the show today, we dig into what these sequences look like, and get to the core of “athlete centered” training in the weight room on the level of variability, and much more.

The holidays are a wonderful time of year! Full of lots of fun parties, events and Christmas parties. That being said, I know this use to be a very stressful time of year for me. I often felt very out of control with my eating. I use to struggle to maintain my weight and would often start January with a big cleanse, diet and restrictive eating and excessive cardio. Not anymore! Learn some of my strategies for finding balance during this busy time of year! Reduce your 𝙁𝙊𝙊𝘿 𝘾𝙍𝘼𝙑𝙄𝙉𝙂𝙎! I get a lot of questions about cravings, binge eating and  if I eat ""junk food"". I'm all too familiar with restrictive eating and labeling foods ""good"" and, ""bad"". I've given up foods cold turkey, and ignored cravings only to binge that food, feel sick, and like a failure for not being able to say no.

It's a horrible way to live and only instills an unrelenting cycle of restriction, over eating and shame. But it doesn't have to be like that! Listen now to learn how I deal with cravings and how I've reduced them. Do you work real hard to look your best on vacation only to go YOLO and eat all the things? I think it is super important to be able to enjoy yourself GUILT FREE on vacation. In the past I really struggled with finding my balance between ""Vacation Mode"" and my regular routine at home. In the past I'd go on vacation and eat things simply because I was on vacation. I would disregard my hunger cues, eat a lot more food than usual and come home feeling...less than great. This would then lead to extremes like adding lots of cardio to my day, skipping meals and living off salads so basic it could be considered grass. Going on vacation soon? Give this a listen! Starting a PUBLIC health &amp; fitness Instagram can be scary! Being vulnerable can be terrifying. I get it! What are people going to think? What is no one sees? What if my friends see? If you're thinking about starting a health and fitness account have a listen!"

"Kampagne ""Wie gehts dir?"" für psychische Gesundheit","«Wie geht's dir?» ist eine alltägliche Frage, die wir leider oft nicht wahrheitsgemäss beantworten.  Die Kampagne macht  ab heute wieder darauf aufmerksam, dass psychische Gesundheit bei guten Gesprächen anfängt. Unterstützt wird die Kampagne von Kurt Aeschbacher, der Prominente im Interview fragt, wie es ihnen wirklich geht. Die Interviews erscheinen im Lauf der nächsten Tage. Praktische Gesprächstipps, wenn es einmal nicht so gut läuft, enthält die Website  https://www.wie-gehts-dir.ch. Man kennt sie als begnadete Slam-Poetin, fadengrade Kabarettistin oder ironische Protokollführerin der SRF-Politsendung «Arena». Aber wie geht es Patti Basler, wenn sie nicht gerade zur Hochform aufläuft? Zwischen 1993 und 2006 nahm die SBB unter der Führung von Benedikt Weibel Fahrt auf. 2008 sorgte er dafür, dass die EM in der Schweiz zu einem Fussballfest wurde. Auch als Familienmensch, Autor, Dozent und Bergsteiger scheint ihm alles zu gelingen. Die Ex-Kunstturnerin gehörte jahrelang zur Weltspitze. Auf die Frage «Wie geht’s dir?» antwortete sie stets: «Gut.», weil das im Spitzensport die einzig mögliche Antwort war. Nach ihrem Rücktritt brach sie mit den eingetrichterten Denkmustern. Heute redet sie offen, auch über ihre psychische Gesundheit. Kurt Aeschbacher führte das erfrischend ehrliche Gespräch mit der Luzernerin."

* The effects of      sugar alcohols on blood sugar, insulin, and your gut.
* How to avoid the      trap of “sugar-free” labels.
* Kelly’s secret      experiment and the results of a typical American diet.

 
Key Takeaways: 

* The three primary      sweeteners to use with a keto diet are Stevia, Erythritol and Monk fruit.
* Sweeteners, even      those approved for a keto diet tend to promote snacking, risking the      chance of overeating, even though you aren’t hungry.
* There are several      sweeteners on the market that say “zero-calorie” but are almost 100%      carbs.

 Your Questions:
 – Why did I develop edema in my lower extremities after I started eating a low-carb, high-fat, ketogenic diet?
  Hey Jimmy and Will,
 I am a natural bodybuilder and have been for over 40 years now. For the past decade, I’ve consume a 100% grass-fed and non-GMO organic diet. In fact I was Paleo before I even knew what that was. In 2017 I started on keto and it was an easy move over from Paleo. I got into a state of nutritional ketosis very quickly with blood sugar in the 80’s and blood ketones between 1-2. My blood pressure improved to 110/75 and fasting insulin down to 3.8. I felt great and had no medical issues whatsoever.
 But then I noticed something pop up out of nowhere last year where I developed edema in my calves, ankles, and feet. I tried upping my magnesium, drinking more water, taking in substantially more sodium, moderating my protein, and doing an 18/6 intermittent fasting schedule. None of it has worked. I weigh 150 pounds have have 9% body fat. Do you have any further suggestions I can do to help with this? What is it about going keto that perhaps let to this condition?
 Warmest regards, 
 Joe – Why have I developed several upper respiratory infections ever since I started keto when I’ve never been sick like this in my life?
  Hi Jimmy and Will.
 Thank you for what you guys do for everyone in the keto community. I only just found this podcast this year and have binged listened to almost all of them. I am a registered nurse and have taking care of the sickest of the sick in the city of Pittsburgh. I now work normal M-F hours with low stress.  I’m on Synthroid for Hashimoto’s hypothyroidism, but my immune system has been so stellar I’ve hardly ever gotten sick. But ever since starting on keto, I’ve had three upper respiratory infections eating this way. While I’ve lost 20 pounds, have great brain health, increased my energy, and spontaneously intermittent fast for 16 hours at a time while stabilizing my blood sugar and increasing my blood ketone levels, these respiratory issues are discouragi"

Kill Cliff Podcast,"Kill Cliff brings you the Kill Cliff Podcast in collaboration with Entreprenerds Comedy. The Kill Cliff Podcast features top performers out there dominating their competition daily. From Olympic athletes and coaches to elite military operators and business minds, this show focuses on the journey of its guests in their unyielding commitment to performance and success.  Kill Cliff was founded and created by a former Navy SEAL with the spirit of giving back to the community and makes clean and tasty sports drinks for energy, endurance, and recovery.  Kill Cliff honors the dedication and sacrifice made by these warriors and their families by donating a portion of the proceeds through an Official Partnership with the Navy SEAL Foundation. Visit KillCliff.com and follow Kill Cliff on Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram @killcliff On this episode of the Kill Cliff Podcast, the guys from Entreprenerds Comedy sit down with Amelia Boone. Amelia is one of the most accomplished Obstacle Course Racing (OCR) athletes in the history of the sport. She has won both the Spartan Race World Championship (2013) and World's Toughest Mudder (WTM) three times (2012, 2014 and 2015). In 2014, she won the WTM title eight weeks after major knee surgery.
 Amelia and The Nerds discuss her quick rise through the ranks of obstacle course racing all while balancing her career as a successful attorney. We talk about the pressures that come along with being the face of a rapidly growing sport, and what it’s like when injuries sideline you from maintaining that title. Amelia gets candid about some personal struggles, internet trolls, WWE finishing moves, and how she’s found strength from sharing her personal story with the world. In this episode of the Kill Cliff Podcast, the boys from Entreprenerds Comedy sit down with the OG’s of the Kill Cliff brand, Todd Ehrlich and GW Garrison. Todd is the founder of the company, and GW joined the team shortly thereafter.
 The Nerds talk to Todd and GW about the challenges of creating and growing a small company, and some of the insane risks they took along the way that helped make Kill Cliff what it is today. Todd and GW were also candid about mistakes made early on at Kill Cliff but how supporting a larger cause (Navy SEAL Foundation) helped them persevere during challenging times.   On this episode of the Kill Cliff Podcast, the guys from Entreprenerds Comedy sit down with Robbie McCall, the brains behind the social media favorite, McDojoLife. Over his 22 years in martial arts and combat sports, Robbie has earned black belts in multiple martial arts and has competed as an amateur boxer and kickboxer. Robbie owns his own karate school but is most well known for running the highly successful Instagram and YouTube accounts, McDojoLife, where he exposes fraudsters and fakes in the world of martial arts.
 Robbie and the Nerds take a light-hearted look at the concept of McDojolife and how Robbie has used his extensive knowledge in combat sports to expose the scam artists plaguing the industry. During the podcast, we break down some of McDojolife’s greatest hits videos, diving deep into how these fraudsters brainwash and swindle their followers. On this episode of the Kill Cliff Podcast, the guys from Entreprenerds Comedy chat it up with Mike Rodriguez, one of MMA’s fast-rising stars. Mike is well known for his flying knee and long, but he didn’t “burst onto the scene”…he’s literally fought his way through the ranks to become a force to be reckoned with inside the octagon. From his first fight in high school (where he logged the first-ever use of a carton of strawberry milk as a weapon) to his appearance on Dana White’s Contender Series to being a dad who’s job is to fight people, Mike, and The Nerds talk about the challenge and the hilarity of coming up in the UFC. After a long break, we are back! The KILL CLIFF podcast has gone through a bit of a makeover. Here's a quick look into what you can expect from the KILL CLIFF podcast 2.0:
 The podcast will be hosted by Jon Cleck and Josh Frank. Both are military veterans that have decided to join forces to create the Entreprenerds Comedy group. 
 In the previous iteration of our podcast, our show consisted of interviews with badass/interesting people. That has not changed. Josh and Jon will simply be adding their own humor and flair to each episode. 
 Be on the lookout for multiple episodes coming out every month!
   Episode 44 is unlike any episode we've had before. Our guest this week is professional skateboarder Bradon Biebel. Biebel has been skating professionally for about 20 years. His sponsors include Girl, Diamond Supply Co, Spit Fire Wheels, Kill Cliff, Glassy Eye Wear, Grizzly Grip, and Ryot.
 Host Mark Zinno and Biebel talk about Tony Hawk's impact on the sport, how Biebel making skating videos put him on the map, dealing with security guards, Biebel's private skate park, his multiple sponsorships, skating injuries, and more. "

Hear why he enjoys his underdog status entering into the final round of his athletic career, and how hitting personal bests at 50 is possible! 6 Pack Lapadat hosts. In an episode that busts some myths, uncovers some truths, and rises new questions, we crunch statistics and look into whether Powerlifting is still growing or shrinking, whether social media has skewed our perception of what is elite and what is mediocre, where the sport of Powerlifting has expanded in the World, and signs that point to a future that may look entirely different! Andrius Virbicianskas joins 6 Pack Lapadat. RTS head coach Mike T, IPF World Champion &amp; TSA head coach Bryce Lewis, No Lift Podcast host Arthur Lynch, and 6 Pack Lapadat take a look at the past decade's biggest influencers, biggest moments, what have been the greatest changes, personal stories, and what they expect in the next decade to come!!

KU Podcast,"Daniel Aipa wants to help you build a kū body and live a kū life.  The goal of The Kū Project Podcast is to share empowering thoughts and stories about bringing more strength and meaning to your life.    Aipa has a curiosity and interest in all things strength. He shares thoughts and interviews guests on their journey of finding strength physically, mentally, and spiritually. It’s a space for talking stories, learning and sharing.  Topics range from fitness and health to finances and career advice, and from Hawaiian Culture and spirituality to minimalism and life-hacking - Aipa touches upon all aspects of life that bring more meaning and strength into your life. In this episode, Daniel Aipa sits down with Mario Quezada of Made x Maker who's a brand strategist, CrossFit Coach, and most importantly a father and family man. In this episode, Daniel Aipa, touches upon solid topics such as the ultimate white vs brown rice debate, whether or not you should put butter in your coffee, and a discussion around exercises that are ONLY for women (which there are none). In this episode, Daniel Aipa goes into topics around Train, Live, and Be Ku. He shares how to properly approach warming up before a workout, whether or not intermittent fasting is right for you, how he approaches training paddlers, and leaves you with a few thoughts on how to be Ku. We are making a comeback to the podcast world and wanted to take the time to say ""Aloha"", give some updates on whatʻs been going on this past year, what Daniel Aipa has been experimenting with and diving into lately, and he shares his morning ritual and thoughts the over complexity of health, fitness, and performance and the need to simplify it all.

Tell your ohana and friends about Hawaiiʻs health and fitness podcast, by Hawaii and for Hawaii. Shoots! Daniel Aipa shares recent news that he came across such as Hawaii's first female QB to throw a touchdown, Alexandria Buchanan, and if women will ever play college football.  He answers how he got into strength and conditioning, if he always wanted to be a coach, and how you can bring up lagging muscles. This is an interview I had with Voices of Truth over a year ago where I shared my story about the history of The Ku project and the philosophy around Build a Ku Body to Live a Ku Life."

Vi kommer omkring hvordan du fx kan håndtere et vægttab uden forbud og om træning, herunder styrketræning til kvinder.Podcast powered by PodBean.com OBS! Hvis du ikke vil høre på Mathias' sang med Figaro, så spol 5 min. frem :)Jeg har besøg af Mathias Haastrup hvor vi kommer ind på hvad vi mener om challenges. Det er januar om lidt og det er her challenges virkelig får fart. Hør hvorfor vi ikke er fortaler for alle slags challenges og hvad du kan gøre i stedet for. Podcasten holder juleferie og er tilbage igen i januar 2020 til en sæson 2. God fornøjelse! Julen er for mange en rigtig svær tid pga. al det spisning det som oftest indebærer. Jeg har i dag inviteret Annemette Struvfe til en gang snak om hvordan du kan komme igennem julen uden at få dårlig samvittighed. Så du forhåbentlig også slipper for at føle dig tvunget til at gå bananas i januar.Podcasten bliver fremadrettet udgivet hver 14. dag. Alene af den grund at jeg må prioritere min tid bedre :) Tak fordi du lytter med! Jeg har besøg af Jonas Germann igen. Vi gennemgår nogle myter som vi tit hører, og tager fat i hvad der er sandt og usandt. Lyt med og bliv klogere på om detox er nødvendigt, om frugtsukker rent faktisk er farligt og er der hold i antiinflammatorisk kost.Note: Jeg kommer til at sige USDA og jeg mener faktisk FDA i podcasten. Carbs, carbs, carbs!Vi hører ofte kulhydrater er den helt store årsag til vægtøgning. Men hvad er egentlig sandt og hvad er de kulhydrater egentlig? Hvorfor er de til og hvad skal vi overhovedet bruge dem til?Lyt med og bliv forhåbentlig klogere på dem. Del 1 - Denne episode omhandler pseudovidenskab og hvorfor det er sexet at bruge det. Vi taler om hvor usexet videnskab kan lyde, men hvorfor det er vigtigt at lytte til videnskab. Et par selverkendelser og hvordan du kan skelne mellem pseudovidenskab og videnskab! Del 2 kommer inden længe, hvor vi tager flere myter og vender dem. Så lyt nu og vent i spænding på del 2! Katrine Gisiger er kognitiv kostvejleder og foredragsholder. Hun hjælper kvinder med at genfinde madro og komme ud af vægttabsræset.Katrine har selv kæmpet med straftræning og selvhad til kroppen. Vi taler om hvordan hun har fundet vej tilbage til at se træning som noget godt for sig selv, og ikke som en straf for hvad hun spist eller gjort. Katrine kommer med værktøjer til hvordan du kan genfinde glæden ved træning."

Lab Rats Podcast,"Andy and Aaron navigate the perplexing maze of nutrition, fitness, recovery, and mindset. They do this by exploring current trends in the world of health and wellness, performing extensive research on each topic, then experimenting firsthand on themselves. Andy and Aaron will use their bodies as living laboratories to find the optimal methods for maximizing human potential, longevity, and wellness. And finally, they will give a recommendation on how to best implement these practices. Andy and Aaron aim to provide you with an understanding of health and wellness in a way that is clear, evidence-based, and informative so that you can live a healthy, long, and prosperous life. The Rats look at over-the-counter pain management drugs, also known as NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs), which include Ibuprofen, Tylenol, Aspirin, etc. We examine the negative side effects of taking such drugs on a regular basis. NSAIDs are one of the most commonly prescribed and purchased drugs today, primarily for purposes of reducing inflammation and pain management. We have all resorted to taking drugs like ibuprofen when experiencing aches and pains, whether it's from an acute injury, chronic pain, or a simple headache; but do we actually know how these drugs are affecting our body? Andy and Aaron take a look at the evidence to answer this question. The Rats talk about the efficacy of elderberry on reducing the longevity and severity of cold and flu systems. This small berry has received a lot of attention over the past few years in regard to immune health, so Andy and Aaron take a look at the evidence to see whether or not it lives up to the hype. They also share their experience taking elderberry during cold and flu season. The Rats talk about the physical, mental, and sociological benefits of Gratitude by diving into the research done by Robert Emmons. They share their own experience with daily gratitude reflection and discuss ways to maximize gratitude to optimize our health and personal relationships. The Rats talk about the evolution of CrossFit over the years and examine rates of injuries in CrossFit versus other forms of exercise. They dig into the causes of most injuries, what you can do to avoid getting injured, and the right way to do CrossFit for longevity. The Rats talk about the practice of Digital Minimalism, made popular by Cal Newport. We discuss the importance of participating in a 30 day ""digital declutter"", changing our relationship with technology, and utilizing only those technologies that add value to our lives. The Rats give a rundown on the history of wine and how production has changed over the years, in both the fermentation process and the quality of ingredients. We analyze the claimed health benefits of wine, ways to maximize those benefits, and the negative impacts of frequent wine consumption."
Lamar’s athletic,Our locker room is a need in change By Jonathan n Jehovany We were talking about how we need a change in athletics
"LAMBERT ON: Helping you address any aches, pains, discomfort and fatigue -in a stressful world.","Exercise therapy is best defined as the prescription of bodily movement to correct impairment, improve musculoskeletal function, or maintain a state of wellbeing. It may vary from carefully selected activities restricted to specific muscles or parts of the body, to general and/or vigorous activities that can return an injured person back to their peak of physical condition. Exercise therapy seeks to accomplish the following goals:¥Enable ambulation; ¥Release contracted muscles, tendons, and fascia; ¥Mobilise joints;¥Improve circulation; ¥Improve respiratory capacity;¥Improve coordination; ¥Reduce rigidity;¥Improve balance; ¥Promote relaxation; ¥Improve muscle strength; ¥Improve exercise performance and functional capacity (endurance)The last 2 goals mirror an individual's overall physical fitness, a state characterised by good muscle strength combined with good endurance. The final goal of rehabilitation is to achieve (when possible) an optimal level of physical fitness by the end of the exercise therapy regimen, irrespective of the initial types of exercise required to remedy an injured persons specific condition. The content we will cover has been devised to ensure a quick return to fitness following the most common injuries and covers ankle, knee, hip, shoulder and back exercises.Preventing injuries at all costsMost sporting injuries occur to ligaments, tendons and muscles, with only about 5% of sports injuries involving broken bones. Most frequent sports injuries are sprains (injuries to ligaments) and strains (injuries to muscles) caused when an abnormal stress is placed on tendons, joints, bones and muscle.  Ways to reduce injury:¥Wear the right equipment - Comfortable clothing and appropriate footwear;¥Increase flexibility - Stretching exercises before and after exercise; ¥Strengthen muscles – Adding resistance exercises to your workouts; ¥Use the correct technique- This should be reinforced during the initial stages; ¥Take breaks – Certain rest periods can reduce injuries and prevent heat illness;¥Stop your workout - If there is sharp pain or a pain that is getting worse with your activity.¥Avoid heat injury - By drinking plenty of fluids before, during and after exercise. Decrease or stop during high heat/humidity periods and prevent heat injury by wearing lighter clothing. Rehabilitation & FitnessEven though I was previously an exercise rehabilitation therapist who has worked alongside physiotherapists, it can never prepare you enough for rehabilitating yourself after an injury or operation. Having had a rest period of 3 months after my knee operation, it gave me enough time to work on my own program related to exercise therapy. This program gave me a platform to work from in order to put together a book which can be found here: http://www.lulu.com/shop/wayne-lambert/exercise-therapy-progressive-rehabilitation-exercises/paperback/product-6007996.htmlExercise therapy plays an important role in the rehabilitation of sports injuries and musculoskeletal problems. Although most exercise therapy rehabilitation takes place in the gym, home exercises are also vital to ensure the success of a rehabilitation program -also outdoor rehab is required if your sport is played outside.

LAMBERTS aim for you - whether you want to implement a c-wb program in your org/improve your body-image in the gym/lose weight/reduce any aches, pains or discomfort - or just to generally feel better tomorrow than you do today
The aim of LAMBERT and our wellbeing consultants is to raise public awareness of ill-health, and assist business owners, their employees, families and local communities to make healthy lifestyle changes and to:
Draw attention to the rise in ill-health and the risks involved of ‘doing nothing’ - to enable key decision makers to intervene in areas such as;
How to improve nutrition, exercise tolerance and reduce stress - addressing any barriers in these areas….and more!

These aims are appropriate now more than ever, because every one of us is a key decision maker (business owner / community representative / and carers for those you love-friends-family- parents of children for e.g. - and once you become more aware of the... Do you have a training personality? 

Vanessa M. Kercher, Ph.D., SSC, M.Ed., BESS, Sep 16, 2019 wrote a great paper on this called -What’s your training personality? i summarise this in this podcast.

She summarised how experience and exercise beliefs can all influence training styles, by looking at the September-October 2019 issue of ACSM’s Health &amp; Fitness Journal where Patrick Freeman described the six different training styles.

I personally recognise some of these styles in my own sessions – do you?
What happens when goals and needs require addressing:

Injury occurs?

You stop progressing?

Ready for change?

Keep your training style in an ideal state by focusing on these four key areas when working with clients.

1. Goals - Creating a framework that fits your goals – realistic? Achievable? current ability, potential capability. Likes, Dislikes – comfort zone
2. Safety - Do you take safety of your sessions into consideration? – ability level
3. Training IQ: Are you training at or above your level? Maintaining your current level -ISQ - consistency in your – comfort-zone? trg preparing for something? Competitive in nature?
4. Satisfaction- What is going to keep you on track - belief? Do you trust in your goals, aspirations? PT-nutritionist -wt loss coach etc. Do you need external support? Do you do HIIT for fitness, health or just quicker results? | LAMBERT ON: Your fitness journey

The basic structure of HIIT – short periods of high intensity exercise alternating with usually longer but still brief periods of lower intensity exercise.
HIIT has been a common component of exercise regimens for many generations. It is designed to:

· improve fitness and

· performance.

The format of HIIT can vary considerably – flexible

Certain research has concluded that HIIT improves the following:
Insulin sensitivity
blood pressure, and
body composition

These improvements are equivalent to the improvements provided by moderate-intensity continuous training.
Inactivity – Low intensity – mod – High

Risks
Current capabilities prior to starting
Injuries -more warm-up required v Time Barriers towards PA
Risk of injury is directly related to size of the physiologic overload i.e. the increase in volume or intensity - similarly the rates of MSK injuries are likely to be higher c/w lower intensities
Safety – combo of poor technique at speed
The duration/intensity of bouts of high intensity periods
The duration/intensity of periods of recovery periods
Similarly, the number of cycles can vary.
Device-measured physical activity, with fit-bits-apple-watches etc
The importance of the principles of physical activity:
Frequency
intensity
Type and
Time

The health benefits of light intensity physical activity will be good for the majority
Similarly, very short episodes of Med intensity PA for those gym-goers 2-3x pw..
Continuity
The best plans -PA or ex are the ones that people CAN and WILL continue to do over the long-term.
When and for whom HIIT is appropriate remains to be determined.
the HIIT population is small and selective, but there is a high level of interest"

"Leadville: The 100 Mile Mountain Bike Race Podcast, p/b Floyd's of Leadville","Leadville — The 100 Mile Mountain Bike Race Podcast, p/b Floyd's of Leadville is the show for people racing (or just interested in) The Leadville Trail 100 Mountain Bike Race. Fatty (a 22-time LT100 finisher), Hottie, and a host of experts answer your questions, give you training tips, detail the course, and tells the stories about the highest and hardest one-day mountain bike race in America: The Leadville Trail 100 Mountain Bike Race. This is it, the final episode of Season 2. We're closing out the show for the year with Alison Tetrick, 3X World Gravel Champ, DK200 Record Holder, and signed up for the 2020 Leadboat Challenge...in spite of the fact that she doesn't (yet!) own a mountain bike. 

Hottie and Fatty also talk a little about Season 3 of the Leadville Podcast, so be sure to stick around after the conversation with Alison! We catch up with Canyon pro racer Jeremiah Bishop, holder of one of the five fastest times ever recorded in the Leadville 100. One of the highlights of the season in this show was getting Jeremiah’s insights, both in our regular show and in the live show we did in Leadville this year. We are unashamed to say we were totally rooting for Jeremiah to take the top spot on the pro podium in Leadville this year. Fate, sadly, had other plans for Jeremiah this year, but he's still got a great story to tell.  Chris Smith raced Leadville for the first time this year. It was a celebration of strength, willpower, and independence...because he raced it after losing seventy pounds, and ten years after being declared legally blind. Riding for the Challenged Athletes Foundation, Chris has a remarkable story to tell. We guarantee you'll be inspired by his 2019 Leadville 100 race report. For this episode, we've got a race report unlike any we've heard before: Joe Stein — one of this year’s LT100 sweepers — tells stories from the very back of the race. It's inspiring, funny, exciting, sad, and surprising. Don't miss it! This podcast spends a ton of time talking about the Leadville 100 Mountain bike race, but have you ever considered the RUNNING version of the Leadville 100? In this episode, Fatty and Hottie talk with Lisa, a 15X finisher of the LT100MTB, about her first attempt at doing the LT100 run. It's an inspiring and personal story, but you'll have to decide for yourself whether it makes you want to try...or to avoid...this event. Fatty raced it. Hottie crewed it — and recorded it! This is the Leadville co-hosts' story of the day, from the starting line (yes we recorded while standing in the red corral) to the finish line (yes we recorded while sitting on the lawn at 6th and Harrison) and beyond. Enjoy our story...then tell us yours. "

A focus on our weight, our ill health, our problematic eating, our laziness, our lack of motivation to train, how stuck we are, that there is something wrong with us, that change is impossible for us... often leads to getting more of that. And feelings of defeat, depletion, exhaustion, apathy and loss of motivation ensue, and we find ourselves heading away from healthy choices and results we really want.

On the other hand, if we focus on the women we want to become, the health we want to have, the healthy behaviours that we want to nourish ourselves with, how change is possible for us when we have the right tools, then we will create more health in our lives. In this episode, Kirsten and Miranda look into the importance of what you are focussing on and how this is what changes your energy, emotions, behaviours and results!

Life often comes down to the decisions we make and if we change our decisions in the moment, we begin to change everything.

You may be experiencing repeating problems with your body, your thinking, your emotions, your eating, your exercise habits, your relationships or another area of your life that you'd like to improve, but you simply don't know why you can't seem to get out of the situation you continue to find yourself in.

In order to jump off the hamster wheel of our reoccurring issues we need to come to a point where enough is enough. Out of desperation or inspiration, we need to make a decision to invest all of the required energy, time and resources into finding real and lasting solutions to our problems, instead of trying to pursue 'quick fixes' that end up taking us on a long detour straight back into our struggle again.

  Everyday there is a spreadsheet working for you.  Athletes are very used to having a lot of their training tracked such as HR, sleep, sleep quality, flexibility, ergo scores, 1x or 2- racing,  Why objective judgement is the critical part of the jigsaw. Intrinsic vs. external competitiveness and why the internal opponent is tougher than the external one. Why competitiveness is dangerous if nothing is ever ‘good enough’. How can or does this spill over from sport to life and why may this be a negative. P 70.    Chapter 4 | Choosing Training Over Cold Turkey. Motivation and Happiness
  When you were 17 you rowed because you loved it and enjoyed the internal motivation of getting better and having fun. Moving to international competition it switched to extrinsic as the focus and goal became success and winning.

 Subscribe &amp; Review on : Apple Podcasts | Stitcher In Episode #111 of the LEO Training Podcast, I interview strength and conditioning and rowing coach, Pat Rufo.
 Pat’s company, RUFO OPTIMAL WORKOUTS®  was established in 2011 to serve as an athletic consulting company for all types of athletes (especially rowers!) and clients of all ages and abilities.
 The goal has been to fill the “gaps” in their training and mindset. Pat has been a strength and conditioning coach and personal trainer since 2007 and has been involved in rowing, sculling, and coaching since 1996!
 His passion is to help his athletes, coaches, and clients believe in themselves and their mission. In addition, he assists parents with understanding their child’s strengths and behaviors that work best for them.
 One final note: This interview was originally recorded in 2018. Since then Pat has continued to evolve his approach and philosophy focusing more on team dynamics, coach/athlete relationships, performance cues and separating ""athlete self"" from ""real self"".
 Pat and I will be doing a second interview later this spring to update you all on what he has learned as well as what has changed.
 With that let’s roll to the interview. Enjoy the show!

LEON on Employee Wellness Podcast,"On the LEON on Employee Wellness podcast you will hear the team from LEON interview makers and do-ers from the worlds of employee wellness, health and fitness, and startups. The fitness studio world has recently been turned upside down by the promise if big growth, multiple locations and a massive brand.

For once, the big debate isn’t about the Crossfit vs Functional Movement. It’s not, do you squat or do you not squat. It’s not even about what's right or wrong for the fitness client. It’s about this idea that I want to grow a massive brand, acquire VC money and live the ""tech startup"" dream.

I’m joined in episode one of LEON in Employee Wellness, with Gavin McKay, Founder of Unite Fitness, a 13 year in the making, mainstay fitness studio in Philadelphia. 

In this chat, we talk all things fitness studio operations. From opening your first studio, developing your personal brand, to some deep discussion on fundraising and the craziness of the fitness world today.

Let Them Eat Grass,"Become a Patron!""Let Them Eat Grass"" follows one farmer, Austin Williams, as he tries to make sense of the often complicated world of food and farming. Only 8 months before he began farming, he too knew absolutely nothing when it came it came to the food he put in his body. Show topics include the importance of real food, the deceptive tactics of conventional food producers, the necessity of revising conventional agriculture as we know it, the beautiful symbiosis possible between public and private lands, and realistic guidelines to find local farmers they can trust. That sounds like something we can believe in, doesn't it? Now, imagine that actually happened. Because it did. We've by and large lost the expectation to be able to see the night sky. It has become the exception rather than the rule. The night sky has been disappearing rapidly from the public consciousness, and it loss is extremely detrimental to more species than just ours.


Birds need it to navigate and baby sea turtles need it to help them get from the beach to the ocean, as just a couple examples.


Join me as I argue for responsible stewardship of one of our most valuable resources.
Support Let Them Eat Grass Rashid Nuri started with a degree in political science from Harvard and ended up as an urban farmer in Atlanta. He's traveled across the post-colonial world to 36 different countries as he sought to aid in nation-building. He wanted a practical skill to help these fledgling nations get off their feet, and he could think of none better than farming. He's on a God-directed mission to bring natural food to communities so they can thrive. Listen to his story.
Special Guest: Rashid Nuri.
Support Let Them Eat Grass Seriously, just listen.
Support Let Them Eat Grass During the 2018 Christmas season, the average American family spent over $1000 on holiday-related expenses. Ironically, the average family surveyed a few month's prior believed they'd only spend around $700. That's a $300 gap between expectations and reality.


One solution is a zero-based budget, and one way to budget is with an app called Every Dollar. I've been using this app for more than two years, and it's definitely the best budgeting app I've ever used.


After all, pasture-raised food is expensive. Our farm's ground beef is twice as expensive as Walmarts, but for good reason! Listen more to find out.
Support Let Them Eat Grass As a farmer, I've come to see just how complicated the world of farming is. Debt, severe weather events, and decades of convention have all helped turn the colloquial relationship with the farmer down the street to the world of globalized, commodity-based farming. Stay with me as I try to parse it out for you.
Support Let Them Eat Grass Diets can be overwhelming and confusing.


It seems like a new one pops up every minute, and ones we thought were new are just rebranded ones from ten years ago. What do we believe?


Especially what do we believe when we have people preaching extremes, and they both seem healthy?


Can we be both fully vegan and fully carnivore? (Don't think too hard about it)


In this episode I explore a possible middle ground for diet. The easiest answer to the question of whether or not I should eat meat is that... we're omnivores. Some meats and some veggies is probably good for everyone. But God created us so magnificently that we're able to survive on the extremes. For this episode I interviewed Mariah Boatright, who was told she probably wouldn't be able to have children due to ovarian cysts. After trying birth control, she switched to a whole foods/pasture-raised meat diet and she now has two beautiful boys!


Listen to the rest of it!

Let's Talk Fast,"Having run a successful Exercise Physiology clinic for over 12 years, I have seen countless fads and trends come along in this time. After a call from my mother in 2015 pleading to help my sister, her health and her bulging waistline, I set out to find a method that would finally see her take control of her health and weight.The last 3-4 years has been a journey into the world of Fasting and Fat Loss which has not only seen my sister finally see progress, but also allowed me to come across a number of amazing people and life changing stories. I want this podcast to be a place where I can share what I have learnt over this time as a way to help introduce you into fasting and see you take control of your Health, Happiness and Weight. I will also aim to have a number of guests on this show, both professionals and people who have lost weight and changed their life through Fasting as a way to expand the conversation and learn from the best in the industry and ordinary people who have found great success through the Fasting Life.I hope you enjoy the content and it helps to spark questions and see you finally take control of your Weight once and for all to see you live a Happy, Healthy and LONG Life. On this weeks Instagram Live I was asked some great questions ranging from alcohol and fat loss and starvation mode to what my thoughts are on The Health and Every Size Debate and MUCH, MUCH more!!!

YouTube: www.youtube.com/thenobreakfastguy I have followed Alan for many years now and his content is not only entertaining but extremely educational. Alan's level of knowledge is second to none in the fitness and nutrition industry and while it has taken almost 12 months to organise our schedules to get him on the show, the wait was ABSOLUTELY worth it.

In this weeks episode, Alan takes aim at the carb zealots of the world and goes into detail on why their hypothesis on carbs causing fat is wrong and why you absolutely can include them in your diet and still achieve your fat loss goals.

I had so much fun chatting with Alan and I want to thank him once again for giving me his time and I hope you enjoy this chat we had together and it helps to see you stop fearing carbs and learn how you can include them in your diet.

If you don't already, go and give Alan a follow over on Instagram (details below) and be sure you take a look at his monthly literature review as it will give you all the information you will ever need on all things health, fitness and nutrition.

I had the pleasure of meeting with Mahalia around a year ago when she came to see me at my clinic and ever since that time we have formed a great relationship and I was very happy to FINALLY have her on my podcast.

This episode is not for the faint of heart as we talk about some very serious topics with some s***s and giggles thrown in, however, Mahalia was kind enough to come on to the show to talk about what she has been through over the years and where she is now and how she has managed to navigate her way through some VERY dark times.

If you are feeling depressed, have suffered from or still do suffer from an eating disorder or just feel like you are alone on this journey we call life, I am positive you will gain some value from this episode. HOWEVER, please know that if you are in need of professional help, PLEASE seek that help as both of us are NOT professionals in this area! We merely wanted to talk about these topics and bring life to them so you don't have to feel like you need to hide it away.

If you want to reach out to Mahalia to ask any further questions, she is more than happy to answer your DM's and so flick her a question and go and say hi!

YouTube: www.youtube.com/thenobreakfastguy I made a promise to you at the start of the year that I was going to start producing more podcasts for you each week and so here is your first BONUS podcast and I think this one is a ripper!

I put up a Question Box over on my Instagram page the other day and the questions I received were GREAT and I thought it would add much more value to go LIVE and answer these in detail rather than in a 15 second video.

I think I might make this become a routine event and go LIVE on Instagram every week at a standard time to answer questions LIVE and also hit record so you can have an audio copy to come back to any time you like.

I answered a TONNE of questions and so I hope this one brings you value and you enjoy the content!

So there are 3 main body types often talked about in the fitness community used to describe why someone has the physique that they do.. these are ectomorph, mesomorph and endomorph. But is there really any validity to this?  

In this podcast I cover the three body types and my thoughts on what actually causes someone to fall into these categories rather than it being some genetic predisposition.

I thought, “What are you talking about? I was never grossly obese!” My idea of grossly obese was a lot different than what I looked like. But then I went home and I thought about it. And when I looked in the mirror, I realized that he was right. I was really overweight and it was very unhealthy. I had narrow sloping shoulders, a wide waist, a huge stomach, love handles that were so deep you could take a sharpie marker, put it in sideways, and the folds of fat would keep it in place…
I decided that I was unwilling to accept that from me. I was unwilling to be that person. I wanted to be healthy and strong again. When I was younger, in middle &amp; high school, I was all about being strong and being healthy and somewhere along the line I’d lost sight of that aspect of myself. I’d lost the drive. I’d lost the internal feeling of what it was like to be heathy.
After the doctor told me that I was grossly obese I went and took a really long look in the mirror. And I decided I was unwilling to accept that from me anymore! I was only willing to accept the best from me with my health and fitness.

Then The Truth Sinks In
That was 15 years ago. Since then I’ve maintained really good shape, really good conditioning. There have been times when my weight crept back up a little bit because I was being distracted by life. But I never got back up over 210 lbs before I reigned it in and got things back into good shape.
The original weight loss I did was from around 260 lbs down to 185 lbs in 6.5 or 7 months and for the most part I’ve kept it off since then.
This is about how to create that fitness mindset. The fitness mindset is what’s help me stay in much better shape ever since dropping all that old weight. If I had just said, “Oh! I’ve got to lose weight!” and that was the goal, then what happens when the weight is gone?
Where is the driving force, the long-term vision once the weight is gone? It goes away for most people because they’ve achieved the goal and then tend to relax. If I would have set a goal that I wanted to get down to a certain weight, then I don’t know what my long-term results would have been.
I Want to Have a Fitness Lifestyle!
But I never set a goal about the weight I wanted to be. Instead, I changed it to, “I want a fitness lifestyle.”
I want a healthy and fit lifestyle, was the change I made. That’s a very powerful change for you to make.
I’d like to help you learn how you can create a healthy and fit lifestyle, how you can start reaching the health and fitness goals that you’ve set for yourself that have seemed out of reach. Maybe you’ve been up and down with your health and fitness. Inconsistency comes from an unsupportive mindset. When you have a mindset that supports what you want, it’s much easier to achieve the results you desire.
You’ve heard people say, “I’ve got to get in my summer shape…”
Screw That! Get in great shape and stay there long-term by changing your mindset!
It’s okay for good shape to be different. We all have our opinions about what being in good shape means. Some people want to be really lean. Some people are okay with a little more bodyfat. Some people want to be really strong. Some value endurance over all other aspects. Some want to be muscular, lean, and strong. What How Powerful is Your Mindset With Your Health and Fitness?
If your mindset supports your health and fitness goals, then you’ll be much more successful. When a person believes and their mindset supports having a healthy and fit quality of life, a healthy and fit lifestyle, then they’ll have much better results than people who unconsciously believe the opposite about themselves, but are trying to force it or trying to figure out a way to fool the system.

There are no shortcuts to having a healthy and a fit lifestyle.
When you believe that you do have a healthy and fit lifestyle, then you will start having the benefits of it long term now.
For those other people, who want to believe whatever else and pretend they’re healthy and fit, eventually it will unravel because until their mindset supports a healthy and fit lifestyle, they will struggle experiencing lasting results
Let’s work together and help you learn how to create the mindset and healthy and fit lifestyle you need to get the long-term results you want now. The long term, lasting results, the ability to have the high quality of life that only comes from your healthy and fit lifestyle.

The Human Mind is Extremely Powerful!
Think about how powerful your mind is. There are many cases where people have healed themselves through humor, by changing their diet, even by spontaneous remission. These things happen. That’s because of the power of the brain. So put the power of your brain on your side when it comes to your health and fitness!
Why wouldn’t you? Get your brain onboard! Get your mind right to support your health and fitness goals. And be very careful what beliefs you accept from others about your ability to achieve what you want.
You Can Do It!
You can achieve what you want! Believe it Now!

Be very careful what beliefs you accept from others about your health, your fitness, and your capabilities. Be very careful what beliefs you accept from yourself about those things. You can choose whether of not you believe your thoughts. A thought is just a thought. What gives it power is the action you take on it.
If you have thoughts that are unsupportive of your health and your fitness, that can be a thing of the past, wasn’t it? Those old thoughts can jut be done now. Now you can start having thoughts that support your health and your fitness, ongoing, long term, can’t you? Right? Of course, you can now… because those old thoughts have vanished!
Start having the thoughts, now, that support your health and fitness. Catch yourself having good thoughts, empowering thoughts, powerful thoughts that get you where you want to be.
Take that step now. Start discovering how many good, supporting, empowering, and powerful thoughts you have every day now that totally support your health and fitness mindset and lifestyle.
Always Remember:
You Are The Master of Your Destiny!

First, let’s clear up some common misconceptions about forgiveness. There seems to be a belief—at least in western society—that forgiveness means you’re saying that, “Whatever happened is okay.”
That is the farthest thing from the truth. Forgiveness simply means that you are letting go of the pain that you’ve been holding onto because of whatever it was that happened.

Let’s clear that up first. You can forgive someone else or even yourself without necessarily saying that whatever happened was okay because maybe it wasn’t okay. Maybe it will never be okay. That happens. And if that’s the case, fine. Forgiving yourself or them might never make it okay.
Forgive Anyway Because Forgiving is Just Letting Go.
Let’s get really clear on that. Forgiving means letting go of the pain that you’ve been holding onto because of whatever happened in the past.
When you let go of that pain, you’ll be able to start enjoying life again. You’ll be able to start feeling better about yourself because forgiveness also means taking your life and your power back!

When you’re holding onto pain or anger or hate or whatever-it-is because of something that happened, then you’re giving up a part of your life to that event or that other person. You’re giving them control over you. You’re giving them control over what you’re doing, what you’re thinking, how you’re feeling…
We’ve all seen the people who go through life as bitter, hollow shells of themselves because of something that happened.
That’s a Choice. You can Let Go of the Pain.
There are also people you’ve seen who had something really horrible happen and they let it go and they go on to live normal, healthy, happy, productive lives because they let it go.
Forgiveness gives you the power to take back control of your life. Imagine that whatever happened is an anchor on the end of a massive chain and it’s holding you back. When you forgive, you cut the chain! Thus freeing yourself up to start moving again now, to start being a part of life now, to start loving and caring fully now, to start being vulnerable again now, to start allowing yourself to experience the full beauty of life now.

Forgiveness also allows you to take back the energy that was expended in staying in that angry, hurtful, hateful, whatever-it-was state. It takes energy to stay there. Forgiveness allows you to take that energy back and instead of using it to maintain that old state, it allows you to take that energy back and start using it in a more productive way in your life. It allows you to move forward, to break free! It allows you to start living again!
Forgiving Ourselves
Sometimes the person we have to forgive most is ourselves. When that’s the case… Do It. Learn what you need to learn so you’ll never repeat whatever-it-was that happened and move on, because you can’t take anything back. You can’t undo something you did. Someone else can’t undo something that they did. Things that have happened, have happened. The difference is going to be what meaning are you giving it.
When you forgive, you can start using whatever-it-was that happened, whether it was you or someone else who did it or whether it was an act of God or act of nature—horrible things sometimes happen that are completely random—for your good. When you forgive and you change the meaning, then you’re able to move more easily and effortlessly through life.
If you’re wondering how you can start? You can start by asking yourself questions like these:
“What can I learn from what happened?”
“What can I take from that that can be positive, that can help me be a better person?”
“What can I take from that that can help me help others?”
“How can I use whatever-it-was that happened to help me be a force for good in this world?”
Start asking yourself better Why People Fail

Before we get into that, let’s discuss, “What is Failure?” Because when you think of the statement, “Why People Fail.” You’re most likely thinking of failure as a horrible result—where the person gets the worst outcome that could possibly happen from the efforts that they’re putting in.
It’s true, that’s one kind of failure. That’s a massive failure. And it happens.
There’s another kind of failure to notice and be aware of.  And that’s the type of failure that happens all the time. It’s the failure that’s a definite and necessary part of the learning process because we can never learn how to do something if we aren’t failing.
When we try something and it works out differently that how we’d expected, that’s a failure.
Right?
How To Use Failure To Grow
You take the results you got. You figure out what part is working and you keep that. The parts that weren’t working you throw out. Then figure out what you need to do differently, and start either over or build on it. It’s taking what works, remembering it, learning from it, and letting go of the rest.
When someone experiences a normal failure that’s a part of the learning process. That’s okay! That’s just part of the gig. That’s how we learn. That’s how we grow! And when we are learning and growing, then failure’s okay.

What about the other failure though, the type of failure that happens when people totally self-destruct? Or when everything falls apart? Or something goes horribly wrong and just totally off the rails?
That’s failure’s a problem. That’s a real problem. There are opportunities to learn from that. You have the ability to take what worked and run with it, and grow and build and figure out what you can do differently next time. And there’s also your ability to completely throw it out and start over. Your ability to be the phoenix rising from the ashes—of your life or the event or whatever happened.
What Causes Massive Failure?
That kind of failure though… The massive failure. That kind of failure comes from a mindset that’s unsupportive of what the person is trying to do. It comes across in things like self-sabotage. That type of failure comes around when the unconscious mind is completely unsupportive of what the conscious mind is trying to do. It can also happen when the unconscious mind forgot to unlearn something that it learned in the past, something that seemed to make sense when it learned it but now isn’t working. And maybe it never worked!
Sometimes, our unconscious minds, learn how to do stuff that never really works. But it fills a need and it’s what we know. So we run with it. The way to overcome that kind of failure is to master your mindset, to start doing things that help support your goals, support your dreams, and support the results you want.

We have no ability to control the results we’re getting. But we can control our efforts 100%. And when our efforts are amazing and they’re brilliantly building on what we want to do, then the results are going to come.
We may get the results we want. We may get better results than we want. It’s our job to make sure we have the mindset necessary to get the results we truly desire. And the way to do that is to start paying attention to what you’re thinking.
How To Overcome an Unsupportive Mindset
This is one of the very first steps. Pay attention to your thoughts. Do your thoughts support what you want? Or are you tearing yourself down? Are you your own worst critic? Or are you your best cheerleader?
It’s good to notice what you’re doing that’s working and what you’re doing that isn’t working. It’s great to give yourself feedback and to get feedback from other people. As you know, there’s a difference between giving yourself positive, critical feedback and being critical of yourself.
What are you doing? Let’s Talk About The Questions You’re Asking Yourself.
What kind of questions do you ask yourself when something goes differently than how you wanted?
If something works out poorly or something random happens that really kind of sucks… What do you ask about it? What do you think? What are you doing with the event? What kind of questions are you asking?
That can make or break you as far as the results you’re getting from life!
I used to ask some horrible questions. And I mean, HORRIBLE QUESTIONS! I would ask things like, “Why me?”
“Why does this happen to me?”
You know what? There’s nothing good that comes from a question like that.
“Why does this always happen?” Is another favorite that people ask. And you know what? It’s a crap question!
So, “Why me?”, “Why does this happen to me?” Let’s replace questions like that.

Any question that puts you in a victim mindset, needs to be gotten rid of.
Start asking yourself questions like:

“What else could this mean?”
“How can I use this to make myself a better person?”
“How can I use this to actively improve the lives of others?”
“What’s the good in this?”
“What’s the positive message here?”

You may or may not have heard about the motorcycle accident I had going on 7 years ago now. I was pulling onto the freeway, going about 55mph when I got sideswiped by a minivan. About 150ft of tumbling down the freeway later, laying there, once I figured out that I was in one piece and that I was still alive… The very first question that I asked was, “I wonder what the lesson in this is and I wonder who it’s for?”
And because I had trained myself to think that way, and to ask those kind of questions when stuff happens, what could have been an absolutely horrendous event turned into just something that happened.
Yeah, it sucked! I was beat up. I hurt for weeks afterward. But you know what? I was ok. I was alive. I could think. I had all my mental faculties. My body, except for a couple of minor inconveniences, was really okay.

If I would have asked different questions, then who knows what would have happened. I guarantee it wouldn’t have been the positive outcome that’s come from it. I use that as a teaching tool. I use it as a way to help people understand how powerful they are, how powerful their minds are and how powerful their outlook on life is.
What kind of questions do you ask yourself? When something happens that goes differently than what you want, are you asking yourself questions that have you thinking in a victim mindset or—and this is what I highly recommend—are you asking yourself questions that get you thinking about things like:

 “What’s the good in this?”
“How can I use this to help others?”
“How can I use this to make my life better?”
“What’s the lesson in here?”
“How can this be something that I can turn into a positive influence in my life?”

Questions like that, they’re going to get you firmly onto the path of mastering your mindset.
And always remember:
You Are The Master of Your Destiny!

Healthy boundaries help us in our relationships, they help us in our personal life, they can help us in all areas of life. It’s appropriate to have boundaries. it’s appropriate to have things where you say, “Woah! Sorry, that’s off limits.”
Boundaries help us to maintain positive emotional states. If we know that there’s something that were unwilling to do, unwilling to be a party of, or unwilling to allow someone else to do in relation to us, then having clearly defined boundaries helps us stay better emotional states.
Why?
Because you’re able to say, “Hey look, that’s off-limits.” Or “That’s something that’s a no-fly zone, it just isn’t allowed.” Or, “I’m unwilling to accept that behavior.”
And you can set boundaries on behavior from yourself or from someone else. It’s best to say, “That this behavior is something I’ll accept and these are things that I won’t.” Or, “These are things I’ll accept and this is something that I won’t.”
Specifically, in Your Relationship
You can choose love—we talked about that in an earlier video—you can choose love, you can be forgiving, and you can still have healthy boundaries.
Having a healthy boundary would be something like, “Verbal abuse will never be tolerated.” And, “Physical abuse will never be tolerated.” Obviously, “Any type of abuse must never be tolerated.” Those are boundaries. That’s, “Sorry. Off-limits. Those will never be tolerated. Those behaviors are game stoppers.”

If something like that’s going on in your life, you can set appropriate boundaries and say, “I refuse to accept that behavior.” And the person who’s doing the behavior, the person who’s being abusive, needs to get some sort of help!  So, they can stop and learn their way past the behavior. Given enough desire and a true willingness to grow, people can learn their way out of all behaviors.
No one is stuck in a behavior. Regardless of what popular culture might tell you, people can change their behaviors. It happens all the time. For the changes to be permanent, they’ve got to come from deep within the person. Lasting change must be from the inside out. If someone stops doing something and they say, “Oh, I’m just gonna stop it.” And they stop, without doing anything to learn their way through it, to grow past it, and truly internalize the changes, then the change will most likely be temporary.
They need to go deep inside, change who they are at their core, and learn their way through, past, beyond, the behavior.
Remember: Set boundaries. Never accept any form of abuse. You must have absolutely no tolerance of abuse!
Other Things You Can Set Boundaries About
What you watch. What you read. What you listen to. Essentially, what you’re filling your head with because the seeds you plant in your mind today grow the thoughts you have tomorrow. Make sure the things you feed your mind support where you want to be in life.
You can also set boundaries about what behaviors you’ll accept from yourself. We talked about that earlier. What behaviors will you accept from yourself? Are you willing to accept laziness? Are you willing to accept yourself sitting around being unproductive?

It’s okay to be unproductive from time to time. it’s okay to relax. It’s okay to take care of yourself. Sometimes taking care of yourself means things like exercise, reading a book, time outside, time with friends, meditating, even watching a movie…
Whatever it is, it’s okay to take care of yourself. I highly recommend you take care of yourself.
When I mention being lazy and unproductive, I’m talking about the individual who does things like, sitting down and playing video games for 12 hours a day, or watching hours and hours of videos or movies, etc. Those might be fun, but they’re in n"

This episode is hosted by Darren Hansen from Hansen Athletics, a previous guest on the show!

Darren was in Michigan visiting some family, so we got together to train, with fellow PowerAthlete Block-1 Coach Chris Sergison. 

We had a blast training early in the morning, and decided to sit down and rap about life, youth athletics, sports, athletic development, and all the related topics such as mindset and mental health. 


These two guys are absolute beast in the gym, but they have a depth of knowledge that is second to none.

I am forever grateful to Power Athlete and the opportunities and friendships that have been created from being a part of the community. 

Please check out this episode, and let us know if any of the topics hit a hot spot for you.

Cheers! ""There are things that scare us that we still want to do, and those are the tests in life. Those are the things we need to seek out and do. Because if you're excited to do something that scares you, that's a test. And I think in order to be successful at it, most things that are scary and hard usually take a while to get.""-- John Allen

Welcome back to the Life Well Dunn Podcast. 

On this episode, I am joined by retired Navy SEAL, John Allen. 

Not only has John served and protected the USA as one of the most elite, he has also founded his company, Elite Meet, which helps connect Special Operations Forces and fighter pilots with top professionals. 

The transition from military life, let alone being a SEAL, to civilian life is incredibly difficult, as John describes. We talked about the similarities between professional athlete's and our military and the difficulties that show up at the end of their careers. In a sense, there is a loss of identity that must be dealt with and understood. 

John takes us through what it means to be a Navy SEAL, how he came to wanting to become a SEAL, the mindset, challenges, and the growth that took place throughout the long journey, and how we can apply this to any fears and dreams that we might have, no matter what it might be.

John is one of the most motivating humans I have ever had the opportunity to speak with. His message doesn't apply strictly to the military life. It is applicable to any challenge or fear you are faced with.

I am grateful and excited to have you here! My guest on this episode is a guy I met a few months back. The way he carried himself regardless of the situation we found ourselves in stuck out to me and I knew I had to chat with him in the future. So, here we are...

Darren is from Pocatello, Idaho. He has been in the strength and conditioning world for nearly 10 years and an athlete long before his coaching career began. He is a great reference of knowledge, but more importantly, we dive into the real make up of coaching--Connection.

We take some time to reflect on our time at the Power Athlete Block One Test, and what a great experience that was. We also dive down the rabbit hole that is nutrition and meat, and how to work with clients and athletes to buy in. 

Darren is an incredibly smart guy. He has a ton of experience, and best of all, he's willing to share it. He is one of the few in the strength and conditioning industry that wants to share, learn, and grow with other coaches to improve the health and performance of his clients and athletes.

The website is officially launched!! Check out lifewelldunn.com for a one stop shop of podcast, Youtube, Blog posts, and of course, your opportunity to train virtually or in person with me!

Okay…back to the podcast!

On the 30th episode, I’m joined by a college friend, Mary Ochsner. Mary is married to a college teammate of mine and is simply living her best life. She is the type of person that lights up a room and makes you feel like you have the abilities to do anything that you dream of doing. She is such a positive, cheerful, and beautiful woman doing amazing things for the world.

Mary found yoga not that long ago, but quickly realized that she absolutely loved it. She claims it was her “glass of wine at the end of the night.” She loves it so much, she became an instructor and has since quit her job and become full time with instructing and developing her presence on social media. Side note, she makes the best tutorials for those of us that are new to the yoga game! She is so incredibly uplifting and easy to talk to.

Mary and I rap about how she got to the point she is right now, and how challenging it has and continues to be, despite her love for what she’s doing. We also dive into the importance of your partner’s support when making these difficult changes and decisions. Mary is a mindset beast and will definitely challenge you to think about what it is you love most about life and make you question why you aren’t pursuing that passion as your livelihood. We dive into how related her current situation is to what she thought she’d become as a child, and how the picture doesn’t always match, but she’s in the same area. 

Definitely check out this episode! There are so many motivating topics and tidbits to apply to your day. If you’re struggling to make a change, give it a listen and try to tell me you aren’t uplifted and motivated by Mary!

You can find Mary on Instagram, @maryochsner and be on the lookout for her new App that is soon to be coming out!

Hosted on the Inspiration Networks of www.oneraregem.com LifeFight Segment 026:  Team USA vs Cuba with special guests champions Brendan Raymer &amp; Drew Gigax!

Cuba has finally decided to open its ports to the US after a long spurt of banning Americans from their country.  They highly dislike our “capitalist” ways and the dictator doesn’t want us to influence his fellow countrymen!  Sooooo… what do WE do as soon as young Castro Jr. decides to unclench his fist, open the ports and allow Americans the opportunity that his father would never allow?  WE GO IN AND START A FIGHT!

That’s right.  American kickboxing promoter Chip Post saw this as a great opportunity to celebrate this suggestion with a kickboxing match up of Team USA vs Team Cuba!  Cuba accepted the challenge and lined up their best men for the battle.  Chip Post then went on a search throughout the U.S. to find the top fighters to represent us.  One of his stops was Andre’s Academy where he asked for my two champions Brendan Raymer &amp; Drew Gigax.  We accepted without hesitation.

Of course I knew the position that he United States was in with Cuba, so when I upped Brendan and Drew’s training for the fight, I also included survival skills training just in case a war broke out.  I educated them on how to make weapons from everyday items; rules on maintaining water &amp; food; how to secure their hotel rooms from invaders and more.  Raymer and Gigax would arrive in Cuba prepared to fight inside of the ring and outside of it if necessary. 

Now if Cuba was going to allow America to “invade” them with their fighters for the 1st historical Team USA vs Team Cuba event, there was no way in the world that Cuba wanted us to walk away with a win.  So the dictator, who owns and runs everything in the country from the banks to the carwashes, was sure to find his top fighters to verse Raymer &amp; Gigax.  Raymer’s opponent was Yosian Garbey, with at record of 13 wins – and 1 loss plus 20lbs on Raymer. Gigax’s opponent was Javier Mesa with a record of 29 wins -1 loss and 10 Kos!  His Kos equaled the number of fights Drew Gigax had within his young career.   

On this podcast you will hear the story directly from Raymer and Gigax regarding what occurred in their fights.  And I guarantee you that that won’t be the most exciting part.  During this podcast I could barely get the two to talk about the fight, because they had so much more to tell about their experience within the country.  Their experiences of a lack of food and water; hourly weight drops and gains; overheating; dehydration; and more importantly, their moments with the citizens of this country that once banned Americans from ever stepping foot on their soil.

There’s a great lesson for us all as Americans to learn that can only be taught to you in this podcast by our two American warriors and courageous top fighters who learned more about America while in Cuba, than they did while growing up on U.S. soil.  I learned A LOT interviewing them and trust me…  you don’t want to miss it!  You and everyone that you know needs to listen to this educational and inspiring interview because on this interview I’m no longer the only one in your corner… champions Brendan Raymer &amp; Drew Gigax are too!
 

Stay Strong! LifeFight Segment 025: Why we overeat

Just the other day I was explaining to Rebekah how I had eaten so much popcorn, candy, ice cream etc… in one sitting while watching a couple of movies that I made myself sick!  I felt like I was about to puke at any moment AND moreover, I WANTED to puke.  Now here’s the catch…  I didn’t want to puke so I could feel better…  I wanted to puke so I could continue to eat more!  Yes, me.  Now don’t sweat me too much because I’m sure you’ve probably been there a couple of times yourself.  But this almost gluttonous moment in my life helped me to realize a new enemy that we had all better learn to stand up to.  And that enemy is called, “Overeating!”  

This is why I felt it was so important to do this podcast on “Why we overeat.”  Overeating is becoming an epidemic in America opposite of other countries whose food epidemics usually stem from starvation or “undereating”.  Now of course we know that one of the reasons that we overeat is because our food is easy for us to acquire.  We don’t have to hunt, grow or harvest anything!  It all sits on a shelf just waiting for us to trade slips of paper for it.  I personally feel that this process desensitizes us from appreciating a lot of the food that we can easily buy.  We take it for granted which can easily lead to our neglect.

In this LifeFight segment, “Why we overeat”, I give 7 reasons as to why we can’t seem to stop from converting our spoons, and forks into shovels whenever we’re around food.  I feel that we all need to control our overeating and the first step is to know “why” we do it.  Here are some of the reasons.

Boredom is a big factor in our overeating.  When the mind isn’t occupied with tasks it easily steers towards food.  Boredom is one of the worse experiences that we encounter as human beings, and we have learned how to battle it with food!  No more boring work conventions or weekends at grandmas, because food will be there!  So understanding that you may be overeating when you’re bored, offers you some insight that could help you to control this behavior.  Find something to do when you’re bored so your mind doesn’t shift to food!

Peer pressure from family, friends, co-workers and even bosses can be a big part of your overeating.  If you’re attending lots of business functions that are always catered heavily with food, this may be your vice.  If some of your surrounding buddies are dedicated overeaters, they are going to be sure to always include you in the duty as they overstuff themselves.  And definitely beware the baking grandmother or mother who may have you confused with Hansel &amp; Gretel.  This can be a hard battle because your family, friends, and possibly even boss could feel insulted when you don’t eat the cooking that they put their heart and soul or money into.    

Visual attraction is another reason “Why we overeat”.  Food companies load their products up with food coloring, carnauba wax, a ½ naked woman and anything else that can convince you to want it for any other reason than simply the taste of it.  And if you’re doubting me I want you to think about how tasty the following items appear:  Cupcakes;  Jelly Beans;  Ice Cream;  Birthday Cake;  Cotton Candy.  Now all of these things are basically the same forms of everyday sugar, but the colors and decorations make us want to gobble them down more than we would if they were just brown or white.

Now of course I know that you know that it is my job to do more than just “inform” you of your enemies who make you overeat.  I will also educate you on how to defeat them!  But you have to listen to the podcast to get that info.  But fret not!  It’s FREE for you to listen!  See.  You never have to worry because…Now, I’m your corner! LifeFight Segment 024:  Beyond CCW

 
Are YOU ready to be a legal vigilante?  Well get your tights and cape out because as of now, it is legal for you to be a superhero in most states in the U.S.  How do you get signed up to play the position of Kick Ass in your neighborhood?  Surprisingly you may be a citizen who already is signed up and has taken on the duty to kick some criminal booty, and in this segment, Beyond CCW, I’m going to give you tips so you don’t end up with your Ass Kicked! 

 

As we zip through space and time things around us change.  And if we want to keep up and survive among those changes, we had better make some changes ourselves.  One of the changes that we’re finding ourselves having to make as Americans is within our self-defense.  Criminals are getting so bold and savvy that they’re manipulating around law enforcement to comment crimes upon the everyday citizen.  Carjacking, home invasions, attacking joggers in the park, are all sneaky crimes that have become so hard for law enforcement to stop, that citizens have voted to take the law into their own hands.  And the tactic that citizens are using is to arm themselves with guns while away from their homes!

 

Of course it always seems a sensible solution to fight fire with fire when your enemy is burning the crap out of you.  For clarification, I personally do agree with arming the 75 year old woman with a .357 who has to walk past the group of gang members in North St. Louis to buy groceries.  All citizens should have an equal chance at immediate defense against a criminal, and we all know that most if not all criminals use guns.  Sometimes law enforcement can’t respond before the criminal does his deed, and none of us feel that our life or the life of a loved one is worth taking the chance to see if the police can make it on time, this time.

 

HOWEVER… even though this has proven to be a sensible solution, there are problems with gun carriers that are beginning to surface.  #1: Some gun carriers feel that they aren’t receiving enough training with the certification course so they still won’t carry their firearm.  #2. Criminals are targeting gun carriers and robbing them of their guns. 

 

Now you know as well as I do that I could hand you a certificate to carry nunchucks and it wouldn’t matter one bit if you have no training with using them. Furthermore, it may be nice that you can swing them around with fancy moves while we’re in the safety of the dojo and you aren’t under any kind of real attack, but how are you going to respond when there’s a serious threat in front of you?  You don’t know because you’ve yet to feel the pressure of an attack with that weapon in your hand.         

 

In this podcast segment, Beyond CCW, I talk about some of the incidents where legal pistol packing citizens are robbed of the pistol that they’re packing by savvy criminals.  I also cover the areas where gun carriers are extremely vulnerable to be attacked BECAUSE they are carrying a gun.  I will give you tips from my Beyond CCW training course on how to assure that you don’t end up on the embarrassing end of having your gun taken from you.

 

There’s much to consider in regards to self-defense if you are a gun carrier than just carrying and having the will to shoot.  The most important is the action of making an effective draw.  There are many things to consider when trying to make an effective draw such as;  #1. Where your gun is upon your person.  #2. What kind of clothing you have to maneuver through to get to your gun.  #3. How close your attacker is to you.  #4. What or who is between you and the attacker. That’s a small example of some unconsidered things that can get you stuck in the draw during a panicking situation.  And this podcast segment, Beyond CCW will cover many more of the angles that you and the certifying.. Segment 023:  Impossible Self-Defense Situations

Hello strong listener.  I hope all is well for you.  In this LifeFight segment, Impossible Self-Defense Situations, I plan to give you some tips, info and even strategies to assure that you never get caught in a situation where it may be impossible to use self-defense.  This could happen to you and believe it or not, it happens to people every day.  This is because criminals think just as we do, and they are becoming savvier in working around awareness and even security features.  And this is why I plan to give you some Intel to keep you ahead in the battle.  

In the opening of Impossible Self-Defense Situations podcast I cover one of the current lessons at my Mixed Martial Arts Academy.  I’m sure you know that most self-defense development occurs inside the safety of the dojo walls, where strong measures are taken to assure that injuries don’t happen.  This gives students and members a confident feeling of safety while also shielding them from the harsh weather conditions.  As necessary as these elements are in a modern dojo for it to operate correctly for modern day people, these comforts can weaken the trainees defense.  How you ask?  By programming the mind to always be comfortable and familiar when executing self-defense techniques.  This will happen to the brain if the trainees always train in the same environment, with the same tone and the same classmates.  Therefore, I took it upon myself to bring a change to my members, and we all trained outside in the parking lot, in our cars!  I showed them how to Hammer Fist the groin of an unwanted passenger; how to donkey kick someone who tries to force their way in the car and more!  It was a great experience for them all that brought a small shock to the brain.  Be sure to extend your self-defense training outside the classroom.

Let’s move along into Impossible Self-Defense Situations.  The first situation that was brought to my attention was the shooting of a reporter while she was conducting an interview.  The gunman walked right up to her and open fired.  She never saw him coming.  Unfortunately she and her cameraman were both killed.  A situation such as this one proves to be very difficult to defend, because reporters are taught to zone out their surroundings when they are reporting.  It is not only a honed skill; it is a requirement that allows them to perform their job well.  Sadly this skill totally diminishes their awareness at that moment.  However, as hopeless as a situation such as this may seem, there is something that can be done to detour this outcome.  I reveal this tactic in this podcast. 

Another Impossible Self-Defense Situation that was brought to my attention was a carjacking that occurred in a woman’s garage.  A lady drove her Toyota Camry into her home garage and hit the button to close the main door.  She stepped out of her vehicle as the door closed but then the door suddenly opened back up.  She looked over at the garage door to see 2 gunmen coming at her through the opening garage door.  They assaulted her and stole her vehicle. 

In this situation the attackers obviously stalked this lady to learn her behaviors, hid as she drove up, then used the safety feature of the garage to gain access to her home while she was alone and secluded.  These carjackers had a thorough plan that they executed in a timely manner.  These types of attacks can be hard to defeat but not impossible.  If you want to assure that you don’t become the victim of a harder working, thinking criminal then you have to work harder on your awareness.  In this podcast I will give you some advice, and tactics to blow the whistle on a sneak attack like this.  

The next Impossible Self-Defense Situation that was thrown at me was very upsetting.  I was surprised that situations such as this one even existed, but horribly the Segment 022:  Magnificent Martial Art Movie Messages

Hello strong listener!  In this LifeFight segment, “Magnificent Martial Art Movie Messages”, I am going to reveal hidden messages of morale that I have found in numerous martial arts movies.  Of course I know just as you do that movies were created mainly for entertainment, but I think there are some movie creators whose intentions are a little more than just selling a ticket.

The original “KARATE KID” may be a corny, old timer’s movie to today’s younger generations, but it is definitely on the top of my list as a deliverer of a Magnificent Martial Art Movie Message.  Even though the main character, Danny, did commit himself to training hard and practicing the martial arts to defeat his neighborhood bullies, there is something else that Danny had that made him trainable, and gave him true hope to defeat the rival experts who had been training way longer than him.  Of course this trait in Danny was never officially pointed out in the movie, and many people may not have even noticed it about Danny.  This trait existed within Danny before he even met the martial arts instructor who guided him on the path to change his life.  This trait of Danny’s was courage.  All through the movie Danny refused to back down to the bullies, even when he knew he was going to get beat up by the whole group.  This is the main power that gave Danny potential to defeat his enemies, and I think the writer and director did an excellent job of strategically placing this message within the movie.

Another favorite of mine that delivers a Magnificent Martial Art Movie Message is “KUNG FU HUSTLE!”  This movie is an incredible act of humor, special effects and super powered martial artists.  It has many messages that it delivers, and one of my favorite ones is the message that, “just because you do the right thing doesn’t mean that you are going to win.”  Of course this message was delivered in a heartbreaking scene, where the star of the show steps in as a child to save a blind girl who is being bullied by a gang of older boys.  Now the star of the show had previously been practicing “The Rotating Palm” martial art style daily before this incident.  He had even developed enough power to make the trees sway when he delivered his deadly strike in the air.  Well, things don’t work out like he expects when he decides to strike one of the bullies with his Rotating Palm technique.  The technique fails and the bullies beat the snot out of him then celebrate by urinating on the defeated child.  Of course our little star is shamed in front of the little girl, and he runs off as she tries to pick him up.  Now the Magnificent Martial Art Movie Message that I saw in this scene was that the little boy succeeded in his effort even though his martial art failed in the way that he wanted to use it.  He still saved the girl even though he had to take the beaten that she may have ended up taking.  This is an important message that we all must learn when it comes to playing the true hero.  Heroes don’t always shine.

The last Magnificent Martial Art Movie Message that I’m going to reveal to you comes from one of my personal favorite movies, KUNG FU PANDA!  KUNG FU PANDA delivers so many messages that I think the writer, and director had to be levitating over a lily pad when they put this hilarious, heart wrenching movie together.  One of the powerfully Magnificent Martial Art Movie Messages that was delicately placed was that, “one’s weakness can become one’s greatest strength when given proper attention.”  Throughout the movie the star character, Po, was ridiculed and even hated for his obese stature.  Even he knew that his body structure did not fit that of the great martial artist that he was expected to become to save the village from the ruthless villain Tae Lung.  When the Segment 021: How to be the baddest Mo Fo in the room

Hello strong listener!  I hope you’re taking all that life can give you and smiling with every trying step that empowers your character!  Today’s LifeFight podcast session is titled, “How to be the baddest Mo Fo in the room!”  And in case you’re wondering what I may mean with this title, I am speaking in regards to being the toughest, roughest, readiest to kick but sum bit*h everywhere that you go!  Now I know you’re wondering how in the heck am I going to convert you into this Double Bad, Fire Breathing Jet Li Dragon over the radio without the disposal of my dojo, pads, bags, and sticks to beat you into shape with!  Well, it’s time that I give you my secrets on how I assure to always be the “The Baddest Mo Fo In The Room” before I even ball a fist. 

The first thing that I am going to teach you is to research who else is going to be where you’re planning to go.  You can’t be the baddest Mo Fo in the room if you choose to attend a place where the losing team of a bunch of pissed off, steroid pumped, muscle head Rugby players are going to go, and drink after getting their butts handed to them by their rivals!  So step one is to always get the best recon that you can on who else may be where you’re going to be.  Now if you choose to attend a High School’s 50 year reunion… you might have being the baddest Mo Fo in the room in your pocket before you walk in the door.

The next strategy to assuring that you’re the Baddest Mo Fo in the Room is to wear loose fitting clothing that you can maneuver comfortably in.  You never know when you may have to defend yourself, so don’t ever skimp on being properly prepared.  When I worked as a nightclub Bouncer I watched too many people lose battles they should have won due to tight pants, tight shirts and jackets.  Every punch, kick or movement that they tried to make during the intense moment was restricted, and basically restrained by their sexy outfits.  Clothing that was too loose was also the dreaded failure of many wanna be Hipsters, as their sweatpants bottoms rolled under their shoes giving their foe the winning advantage as he tripped to the ground. 

Carrying secluded weapons is another way to stay on top of your gain to be the Baddest Mo Fo in the Room!  Now understand what I mean when I say, “secluded”!  This means no showing off and bragging to your buddies about it!  Keep it to yourself in an unknown, concealable, easy to get to spot.  Now I don’t want you to think that I’m offering you the freedom to break the law because I’m not.  You’d be surprised at the legal items that you can carry that make better weapons than the one’s regulated by law.  And yes I actually do reveal some of these items in this podcast to help you be the Baddest Mo Fo in the Room!

Remember to NEVER sacrifice safety and security for comfort and/or fun.  If an incident happens to you or someone that you care for, it will be devastating and will cause unpredictable changes in the life that you’re used to living.  Listen to “How to be the Baddest Mo Fo in the Room” and learn some easy preparedness and awareness tactics that may someday save your life.  Then assure that everyone that you care for also listens so all of you can always be safe and ready.

We answer questions submitted from the internet: ""How do you recognize the difference between your training helping you vs hurting you?"" and ""If a lack of strength is holding an athlete back, should they keep the rx'd loading &amp; scale the reps, or is it better to scale the loading &amp; keep the rx'd reps to maintain intensity?"". And of course, we also went down a couple of wonderful rabbit holes. Part 1 of a 12 part series dissecting the CF Linchpin 12 Tests. In this episode we dive into Test 1. The Linchpin 12 Tests, aka, the Dirty Dozen are 12 benchmark workouts we created to help athletes and coaches assess their fitness across a broad range of movements, loadings, rep ranges and time domains. All 12 Tests can be found on our website at www.CrossFitLinchpin.com We discuss the 10 General Physical Skills from the foundational CrossFit Journal Article entitled ""What is Fitness?"", from October 2002. This topic was inspired by a question from a member of the Linchpin community who wanted to know about the various aspects we hope to develop when we work out."

Live Fit Podcast,"Live Your Life Healthy, Fit, & Free Happy Anniversary to the Live Fit Podcast. 



It was six years ago, during Thanksgiving weekend of 2013, that I put together my first three episodes of the podcast. 144 episodes later, I’m still bringing you interesting and educational shows from the top experts in their field.



In this episode, I bring you a professional on eye health. I’ve never had anyone talk about eye health before, and I thought it was high time. Now, what’s great about today’s guest is she’s not only an ophthalmologist, but she is also a  neuro-ophthalmologist AND is a functional medicine doctor. This means she prefers to treat people through holistic, natural methods before resorting to drugs or surgery. She is also an expert with headaches and migraines.







Dr. Rudrani Banik is a Board-certified Ophthalmologist, fellowship-trained Neuro-Ophthalmologist, and Functional Medicine expert. She is fully trained in ophthalmic surgery and Botox, and she has a special interest in treating Headache and Migraine. Dr. Banik manages a wide spectrum of conditions affecting vision, as well as the complex connections between the eye and brain.



Dr. Banik has specialized training in Functional Medicine. She applies principles of complementary and alternative medicine in conjunction with traditional medical approaches to treat chronic diseases affecting the visual system. She offers a unique approach to managing conditions such as dry eye, macular degeneration, blepharitis, migraine, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, thyroid eye disease, uveitis, and other autoimmune conditions.



She takes into account a patient’s unique medical history within a psychosocial context. Her approach is to develop a personalized treatment and wellness plan for each patient, including a combination of:



Root cause analysis for chronic eye disease to identify imbalancesPersonalized nutritional plan for optimal vision and brain healthPharmaceutical grade supplements to promote eye and brain metabolismLifestyle modification to address stressors and improve sleepEssential oils, meditation, and movement for vision, mind, and body



Dr. Banik has thirteen years of training at some of the finest medical and eye institutes in the country. She graduated with a B.A with Honors and M.D. from Brown University. She trained in Internal Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami, followed by Ophthalmology at the University of California, Irvine. She went on to pursue Neuro-Ophthalmology at the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins.



She has served on full-time faculty at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, and New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai.



Dr. Banik is founder of Envision Health NYC, a private practice based on the Upper East Side in New York City. She is Associate Professor of Ophthalmology at Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine. Dr. Banik has won many teaching awards and also serves as principal investigator for 5 multi-centered clinical trials in neuro-ophthalmology. She has authored numerous articles and has presented at national and international meetings. Dr. Banik is a member of the American Academy of Ophthalmology’s Exam Development Committee and helps to set the standards for board certification in her field.



Dr. Banik is sought out as an expert in the media and has been featured in The New York Times, Good Morning America, CBS Evening News, ABC 7 Eyewitness News, CBS NY with Dr Max Gomez, Fox 5 News with Ernie Anastos, NY Magazine’s Best Doctors 2017, 2018, and 2019, The Washington Post, New Tang Dynasty TV, and Real Simple magazine. She was voted Castle Connolly Top Doctor 2017, 2018, and 2019 by her peers.

Why, and what kind of, nutrition is good for your eyes.What foods and drinks are not good for eye health.Blue light – Goo Heads Up Health is the first software of its kind to put the patient’s health records and data directly in the patient’s hands, centralized all in one place, allowing them to make informed decisions about their own health.







Founder, David Korsunsky has fifteen years’ experience working for industry-leading technology firms and most recently served as Director of Technical Alliances at VMware, Inc. where he led strategic partnerships with global EHR companies including EPIC, Cerner, McKesson, GE, Allscripts and many more. As an avid health enthusiast, and navigating a health crisis of his own, he recognized an opportunity to build a software solution that makes it easier for anyone to take control of their health through centralized, easy to understand data. 



 Heads Up Health was founded by a team of health-conscious technology experts on the simple concept that being healthy doesn’t have to be complicated. By evaluating a world of disjointed medical records, underutilized health tracking technologies and abundant, but poorly managed, health data. The founders felt that intelligent software could provide the perfect solution.Based on their belief that well-organized data holds the key to optimal health, they created a state-of-the-art electronic health records technology to instantly centralize and organize a subscriber’s complete medical history Allowing them to:



 Electronically integrate medical records from thousands of health systems, doctor’s offices and laboratories.  See trends in your medical history across all your current and past providers  Track functional medicine and other specialized lab panels   See how lifestyle modifications (diet, sleep, exercise, stress, etc.) affect clinical markers of health and disease 



The software integrates with more than 20,000 hospitals and healthcare systems across the country like The Mayo Clinic, Stanford Health System, and the Cleveland Clinic. It provides full data integration with labs and pharmacies including Walgreens, CVS, Quest Diagnostics, and LabCorp. And it syncs up perfectly with health-tracking apps such as Apple Health, GoogleFit, FitBit, MyFitnessPal, and Garmin.

(Visited 1 times, 1 visit today) Lane Kennedy was a guest on this podcast back on episode 128. At that time she shared with us how Western medicine let her down, how she became a biohacker, the values of mindfullness and stopping to smell the roses and how she benefited from CBD. In this episode, Lane shares her new book, how she has found harmony in her life and how a form of meditation has changed her life and allowed her to thrive, not simply survive.



Lane Kennedy began a successful modeling career in her early years and was graced with the gift of sobriety in her twenties. She’s traveled the globe, founded successful companies, and pushed against the glass ceiling. As a seeker, she reached to harness the power of human potential. She became a graduate of the Neuroscience Academy of Australia.  Was one of the first graduates of well known “bio-hacker’, Dave Asprey’s Certified High-Performance Coaching program, and was first up to complete Dr. Sara Gottfried’s practitioner course, The Hormone Cure. 



She then became certified in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to compliment her decades-long meditation practice. She discovered a not very popular, yet ancient form of meditation called Yoga Nidra, sometimes referred to as Yogic Sleep. She enrolled in two separate programs to become a certified Yoga Nidra teacher. Yoga Nidra is the deepest, most profound, form of meditation she has yet to experience. It has given her her freedom – freedom from overthinking, freedom to rest, and the space to allow more love into her life. In service to others, she shares meditation with everyone. 



Her clients include Department of Defense, The SF Police Academy, Zuckerberg General Hospital, and many private clients. She is honored with helping others tame the mind, de-stress, eliminate anxiety and sleep more deeply.

(Visited 14 times, 1 visit today) I had Cliff Ravenscraft on the Live Fit Podcast back in February of 2016 on episode 76 “Free From the Tyranny of the Scale”.  Since that time, he’s stuck to his commitment of exercising six days a week, eating healthfully (most of the time), and maintaining his good health mindset.



About five years ago, Cliff had a health scare that lead to him adjusting his belief system. Through study, prayer, and support, he was able to change his lifestyle and thought process to be health-minded. This meant he had to change the way he thought of food, physical activity and even, himself.



On November 14, 2014 Cliff made a commitment to himself to live in a way that is respectful and healthy to the body. This included finding balance between work, family, fun, and other commitments. Because his is a man of integrity, he had little trouble sticking to his plan, yet his mind still wasn’t quite made up. Since that day in 2014 when he made this commitment, he’s drifted a little, but always returned to his anchor of wanting to make his body healthier so he can live a long vibrant life for him and his family.



Over the course of the last five years, Cliff has discovered that he had a set of beliefs that were holding him back. He had to change these beliefs in order to move forward to his good life.



Thought of himself as a man who lost 72 lbs (“I’m a 272 man who lost 72 lbs”)All or nothing – either he would follow my plan 100% or 0%That he would gain the weight backThe last 10 lbs are the hardest



In order to make lasting changes to his health, he had to make permanent changes to his beliefs. He believed:



Be a man of integrity (and do what I say I will do)My identity is someone who exercises 6 days a weekI put healthy foods in my body so my body will be healthy

Live Wild or Die. Presented by monkii.,"An ongoing conversation about Wildness, the monkii lifestyle, and physical training. monkii Dan is the co-founder of monkii and Elder of the monkii Society. Our goal for ourselves as well as the entire monkii community is to keep getting wilder. Tune-in to a world-wide discussion about how to live wild. Howdy monkiis,
This episode was inspired by some recent training, some recent podcasts I've listened to, and a few books I've been reading recently. 
I have started to include more isometric training as well as single-arm training specifically into pulling exercises (Rows/Pullups). I feel that this helps to pull the shoulders back and combat the constant rolling forward of the shoulders due to our modern world/phones. I've also been including regular single-arm pull training with Rows and Pullups. It's been a goal of mine for years to be able to do a one-arm Pullup. Maybe 2020 is the year... 
I've also been including a regular sauna session after training 2-4 times per week. It feels WILD and I also include stretching in the heat. This significantly improves my range-of-motion and I see a real difference. Try it.
I listened to another episode of The Ready State podcast in which they discussed how the mind plays a role in endurance and performance. Alex Hutchinson was the subject-matter-expert and there and a ton of great takeaways for monkiis.
Lastly, I am psyched to introduce the monkii Book Club. Basically, I wanted to share some of the books I have read, or, am currently reading. I recently completed Empire of the Summer Moon and am about 1/3 through Sapiens. I cannot recommend these books enough and they actually have quite a bit of crossover so reading them back to back is encouraged.
If you haven't already, we Wildly appreciate and thank you if you can take the time to leave a 5-star review. It helps to spread the good word of the Wild and grow the monkii family. 
monkii on!
-monkii Dan
www.monkii.co Hey monkiis,
This episode was inspired by an episode of The Ready State hosted by Dr. Kelly Starrett and Juliet Starrett. Their guest was an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Nick DiNubile who discussed the current state of musculoskeletal health as well as what we can do to make sure that we do not have to go see people like him. They really emphasize the concept of preventive body maintenance as well as taking personal responsibility for our health and wellness. Western medicine is GREAT as curing diseases and fixing broken bones. However, it's not so great and promoting health, fitness, and wellness.
Thanks for tuning in and if you haven't already, we monkii Elders would be eternally grateful if you could leave us a 5-star review. It helps to spread the good word of the wild.
monkii on!
-monkii Dan

  Hey monkiis,
Thanks for tuning into this quicky episode. I received some great feedback from a variety of monkiis who tuned into the last episode ""Stress and Anxiety"", thank you! I am compiling your tips, strategies, and tactics and look forward to sharing them with the monkii family.
I've been much more focused on mobility and flexibility in the last few months and cannot overemphasize the importance of this, especially for the long game. I want to be able to be as Wild as I am now in 50 years and to achieve this I have to train smart. We will keep going deeper on this topic.
Thanks for tuning in and we monkii Elders would be eternally grateful if you could leave a 5-star review. Thank you!
monkii on,
-monkii Dan
www.monkii.co Hey monkiis,
On this episode, I share some thoughts on stress and anxiety. For the last month or so, I've been waking up between 2-3am and can't fall back asleep. There is no one specific reason, it's just that life has gotten more complex and there is a lot to manage, problem solve, and remember. This unfortunate lack of sleep has made me realize how important the mind is to overall health and well-being. My good friend and monkii co-founder David has always said that peace of mind is priceless. I often find that a lack of peace is often due to my own actions more than something external. I think that is why it causes so much more rumination and is so much more disruptive. For pretty much my whole life I've always focused on physical training in lieu of any sort of dedicated mental practice. However, this last month has really made me realize how important that is. It doesn't matter how fit you are if your head is a mess.
If you haven't already, the monkii Elders would be eternally grateful if you could leave a 5-star review wherever you get your podcasts. This really helps to spread the good word of the Wild.
monkii on!
-monkii Dan
www.monkii.co Hey monkiis,
To begin, I want to give a shout from the Wild to Sophia (who will now be known as 'monkii Sofia'). She received a pocket monkii for Christmas and was PSYCHED! Myself and the Elders of the monkii Society welcome you to the journey towards Wildness and look forward to seeing your monkii training. Keep getting Wilder!
On that note monkiis, how's your training going? I've found it very useful over the years to document as well as share my training. It helps me to analyze what I'm doing and adjust as necessary. On the flip side, when I hear someone talk about their training it gets me PUMPED to go train myself. Maybe you will get the same excitement from these type of episodes. I hope so.
We would be eternally grateful to any monkiis who can take the time to leave us a review. It helps to spread the good word of the Wild and grow the monkii family. Thank you!
Get out there and monkii on,
-monkii Dan
www.monkii.co Hey monkiis,
This episode was inspired by a question by monkii Lotki (IG handle @lotki.vo.marr). He sent a note via Instagram asking about the monkii Elders experience with rock climbing and how to train for climbing with monkii bars and/or pocket monkii.
Thanks for tuning in and if there is a topic you'd like to hear about, please send us a note.
monkii on!

Live Young Show,"The Live Young Show gives you the insights you must have to stay younger for longer. To really slow aging, you’ll need a multi-pronged approach. There’s no single, magic product or solution that’ll do that for you. It’s all about correct lifestyle choices. This includes things like diet, exercise, stress management, meditation and more to get the anti aging results you’re after. Starting right now, you can begin creating optimum health, a life enhancing lifestyle, a longer, more fulfilling disease free life. It won’t come easy. It takes focused, persistent action.

Join us at www.howtoliveyoung.com Let’s take a look at what we can do to get the best quality sleep possible. It’s not just about the length of time. It’s about how to get into that sleep mode where the most repair and rejuvenation takes place. In this episode of The Live Young Show, I talk about sleep, as in getting enough of it. How much is enough? Well, we’re going to take a look at what the science recommends. In this episode, I want to talk about the Ketogenic or Keto Diet and how it can help you with your health, your longevity, your mental clarity and all those annoying issues that come with age. In this episode, I want to share with you four important supplements that can help you stay younger and improve your overall wellbeing. In this episode, we’ll take a look at how getting control of your mind and the way you think can help you stay younger. I’ll introduce you to an excellent book that will be of great benefit to you. It’s called “Think Forward to Thrive” and it teaches you how to create the future you want rather than trying to re-create the past. So how do we tackle this thing we call aging? Just what can we do to slow or reverse aging, including all those related diseases that getting older brings? It all comes down to adopting an optimum lifestyle that’s sometimes completely opposite to what you’ve got going on right now."
Live Your Own Fit Podcast,"The Live Your Own Fit Podcast is helping you see the big picture of health and performance.

He also shares his reality and journey of living with an undiagnosed fatigue/health issues over 20yrs, and what he has learnt that is finally turning his health around. Pete gives his top 3 technique tips to get you running more efficiently. Posture, cadence(arm carry/swing), and foot fall.



But really there is a hundred tips in this podcast as each topic is explained in detail with many examples of drills, technique, cues, and much more to focus on. Including a fourth overriding cue that you must think about at all times.



Pete talks about what shoes he's been wearing, what he likes in a shoe for different runs and situations.



Xero shoes are Pete's ""go to"" training shoes, everyday sandals, and dress shoes too!

Yeah Hi it's me Tate and we're here to talk about running today so I'm pretty excited because running is one of my favorite things to do and talk about and we're going to talk about running shoes running technique barefoot, fore foot, changing, sticking with what you've got so many things . Let's get into it so one of the main things that always comes up around running is technique and form how to be more efficient. And when I'm talking to the guys that I coach about sticking to math hot right that's one key element but the next. I really need them to send me videos of how they look when they running. Because there's such big time gains to be made by improving technique especially at a slow pace so when you're running fast everybody runs. Sounds fairly similar. Why did easier to run? Just run faster than it is to run slow with good form efficiently so when the Ghazal asking the math and at the start they running maybe around that six minute case which is pretty slow running. It's quite hard to hold good form at that at slow pace so it's crucial that we get them on the track with good form and say they videos. which is this is a Ramada as wells to some of them to sending their videos so that we can give them good fade back and get that progression happening sooner? So they're not running at six minute case so it doesn't feel slow and painful handful running at math. We want to stick with the same hot right but improve your spayed with good technique and overtime that improvement will also be in the aerobic capacity. So that you'll just get faster and faster so all the Times that I've spoken about running technique and taught running technique comes down to just has three things. The three main things that I recommend people focus on the first is pasta. The second is cadence or carrying swing thing and the next is footfall. How's your foot connecting with the ground? And what position so the four I get into. It is WANNA stay that everybody is different different. Everybody will look different running. Everybody's going to have different by mechanics. I longer limbs shorter torsos all that different stuff so these are just my recommendations for how you could improve your running. If it's not for you then don't worry about move on get some feedback on how you can improve your personal technique so first off. Let's stick with posture posture is. It's like running proud so a standing toll thing toll not only connects the mon- with good feedback but it also helps switch on muscles in the body that weren't normally switched on so good. Protein – Why is protein important?

 

What does protein do?



Why do we need to eat protein? (answer – protein synthesis)



Just a few simple questions that Jaimielle and Pete Jacobs answer in this Protein Podcast.



We also cover 

How we build new cells using protein.

What other vitamins are needed to convert some amino acids into beneficial substances.

Vitamins and amino acids that improve fertility..

Easy food choices to increase protein intake.

Supplemental amino acids to make protein synthesis more active if protein intake is not optimal (vegetarian or vegan diets).

Holistic health and how everything is connected.

Cellular repair, reproduction, autophagy.

Ideal protein intake slows aging process.

When to eat protein and how much at each meal.

Different protein requirements for younger or older people.



We are already working on part 2 to clear up and elaborate on some of the things we mentioned here, but if you have any parts you'd like to know more about, make sure you message us at pete@liveyourownfit.com or jaimielle@liveyourownfit.com

or on any of our social media pipes @liveyourownfit  @petejjacobs  @jaimielle or through www.liveyourownfit.com Mindset tips and techniques to improve your performance, from a Hawaii Ironman World Champion (me, Pete Jacobs)



In this Live Your Own Fit  Podcast episode Many tools, tips, and examples are given for staying mentally strong, to get more from your physical ability, to push your limits, and find out how tough you really are.



Topics covered include:



What is mental toughness and how do you build mental toughness?



How much does performance outcome depend on mindset and the brain?



How do our thoughts effect our physical performance?



Tim Noakes' central governor theory and the importance of training to increase pain tolerance.



Research quoted from Alex Hutchinson 'Endure' book - why having a plan is important, but being able to adapt to change is just as important.



Everything on race day, your ability to go harder, faster, for longer, is driven by your mind, your perceptions of your environment (everything you see, hear, feel), and your ability to extend your mental reserves of pain tolerance and motivation.



Perception is everything. Your nervous system reaction, how tired your mind will become depends on your ability to control your perception.



Using stimulants is one way to lower your perceived effort, and therefore allow for more physical energy to be accessed.



Gratitude and controlling ego are other mindset techniques to bring your awareness to the 'now' and calm your nervous system and conserve mental energy.



So much is covered in this podcast, there will be something for everyone, particularly those about to race the Hawaii Ironman World Championship in Kona later this week (October 12 2019).



I (Pete Jacobs) am not racing this year, but hope my comeback continues to build and I will be back on the big island in 2020.



I hope these race mindset tips help you to stay focused, strong, and build mental toughness, confidence, and your best ever performance.



Good Luck



Pete



 



  Have you ever wondered how far you could go on zero carbohydrates? Can the body perform at a high level of intense exercise for more than 2 hrs without depleting glycogen stores? How far can we go using just the energy stores in our own body?  Do we need to risk a distressed gut and cramping stomach in order to push our body to its' limits?



I don't have any of these answers, but I did recently complete two Ironman 70.3 events one week apart on a zero carb, carnivore diet, and while only using caffeine, ketone esters, water and salt during the races.



I'm only scratching the surface of my tests into how much can my body do with stored energy. This podcast talks about my races, how I approached them physically, mentally, and nutritionally, while following my carnivore diet, and my instincts.



Yes, it is possible, and perhaps beneficial, to not be carb loading, to not eat carbs at any time, and perform at a higher level than with carbohydrates.



I'm still learning more every race, and every day, so please send in any questions you may have, and I'll try to answer them, or ask those who are much smarter than me their thoughts. You'd be amazed how vague a lot of the science is, how little, or none at all, research has been done regarding what I am doing, so the energy pathways are somewhat untested at this level, and I'm loving the experimentation process.



Hope you enjoy this episode.

  Our LY.F family inspire Pete and I everyday, giving us that warm fuzzy feeling of gratitude, and love for doing what we do.



Camilla is one of our LY.F Stars who has just finished the 6 Week Life Change Program. Her health and performance journey over the last 6 weeks has been inspiring to say the least. With Camilla’s consent we want to share her health story of trials, and wins with you.



For a more in-depth article on Camilla's journey, click here to head to www.liveyourownfit.com



HOW DID CAMILLA SET HERSELF UP FOR GLOBAL HEALTH &amp; PERFORMANCE SUCCESS?



 	Camilla established her foundation to success - her WHY, WHAT, HOW

 	Acknowledged roadblocks and what she could do to overcome them

 	Established her bio individuality – through a two week elimination protocol in the first two weeks of the program, Camilla established her individual nutritional plan

 	Recognised that she is an athlete in LIFE, she deserves to live her best life, to her full potential.

 	Discovered how to ‘biohack’ her physiology for the results she wanted. i.e She increased her sleep by an hour, from 6 hours to 7hours.



KEY MESSAGE



If you are in an energy deficient state your body will go into fright/flight mode, causing a negative domino effect on your hormonal system, ultimately resulting in ‘nervous system fatigue’/ ‘adrenal system fatigue.



 	Camilla was energy deficient – her resting metabolic rate required 1,875calories daily. She was only consuming around 1200. This causes stress hormones to rise, increasing inflammation and inhibiting fat burning and fat loss, amongst countless other ill effects.



 



CAMILLA'S RESULTS AFTER THE 6 WEEK LIFE CHANGE PROGRAM



 	Camilla has lost 8cm around her waist.

 	Her rings are looser, and her shoes feel bigger

 	Her energy levels are higher, and she seldom experiences the 4pm slump

 	Her slight anxiety has gone, and she is attracting even better things into her life

 	Her stamina has improved

 	She is waking up refreshed and renewed, experiencing high quality sleep (increased to 7hrs), and no longer snores

 	Camilla is ready to try a resistance training program

 	Camilla realised she had been in an 'energy deficient state', meaning previously she had not been consuming the calories needed at rest, let alone to function optimally throughout the day.



CAMILLA’S WORDS THREE WEEKS INTO THE 6 WEEK LIFE CHANGE PROGRAM



Huge thanks to Jaimie and Pete for their amazing Live Your Own Fit Program.  I’m an unfit, busy wife and mum and I work full-time.  In summary, there isn’t much time for anything extra.  Jaimie has helped me lose cm’s, find more energy and we are only three weeks in.  



As I’m not an athlete (AT ALL), I didn’t know if the Program was right for me, or if Jaimie would understand – she has amazed me and TOTALLY gets it.  Her unwavering support and excitement is infectious, AND her ability to come up with a healthy filling meal in under 5mins is magic.  



Some days are more difficult than others, but with all the information provided, it doesn’t take long to get back on track.  I highly highly recommend the LYOF program to everyone – including unfit busy mums, who look at a push bike in horror – maybe soon!!!



 









If you have any questions you would like to ask or feel like you would like to discover your 'best self', then reach out......we are only a button away!



 



Yours in health and performance - with love



Jaimielle Jacobs Carnivore, Low Histamine Diet. Can it get much more selective? haha. Actually, I find it super easy and don't mind it, less choice in my day simplifies my life :) And it's especially easy since I am now feeling much healthier and have more energy, so EVERYTHING IS EASIER!



I've had muscle and mind fatigue, and brain fog issues, since I was a teenager, gut issues since my early 20's, skin issues since then too, achy joints from 30years old, and everything worsening together into my mid 30's.



Going carnivore removed most of these issues, at least in severity. Dr Paul Mason was a huge help to my mum and I in this respect. He has some brilliant presentations on Youtube from Low Carb Down Under conferences, and Carnivory Con. However eating what seemed like the same foods day after day, I was still getting some symptoms back, and I couldn't figure it out. UNTIL...



Until I watched Georgia Ede MD on youtube talk about histamines from a clip published 5 years ago.



Histamine became my new interest, and I added that to my already ""limited"" carnivore diet.



I had been eating aged meats, and loved them.. but once I heard about histamine in aged food products I instantly recognised my patterns of fatigue and skin problems with times I had eaten meat that was not as fresh. Combine that with yoghurt or hard cheese and lots of bacteria equals lots of histamine.



This explains why I can have some, in small amounts, but it is the OVERDOSE of histamine which is an issue, not histamine itself.



So consider when you eat something high in histamines, (aged food eg. wine, cheese, yoghurt, cured/aged meat) how do you react if you eat a lot of these products?



If you have gut issues it is likely histamine overload is playing a part, or more accurately, has become a problem due to your gut dysbiosis, and is contributing when histamine levels rise.



Leaky gut is tough to deal with, so many things can be affecting you, but trying a low histamine carnivore diet is a great place to start, then reintroduce foods one by one every few days. HOWEVER, as my mum and I have found out, just because you can tolerate it, does not mean you can have it frequently or in large amounts - keep in mind it is in the DOSE that is your poison, not the food itself.



An overdose of histamine can be more likely after added stress, i.e. stressful events - exercise, heat, poor sleep, late nights, other food combinations, etc. which all make your body more REACTIVE and your gut lining more PERMEABLE



If you have experienced autoimmune symptoms, you will understand your cells REACTION is the problem, so do what you can to calm your cells and nervous system-  vagus nerve exercise are an excellent addition to everyday habits to help lower you Sympathetic Nervous System (and cellular response).



Buy meat the day the butcher gets it, freeze it, then defrost quickly and cook quickly (not 24hr slow cook). Histamine builds up in food at any temperature other than freezing, and is not removed by cooking   - so freeze leftovers.



Lots more information on my podcast about my low histamine carnivore diet. And this is just a snapshot in time at how I'm currently eating, and what is working right now for me.



Please send me any questions or personal anecdotes over social media @petejjacobs or email pete@liveyourownfit.com

Joining me is Lori Beard-Daily, the Chief Now Officer for Working on Your Now! The  idea came to her a few years ago. Like many women, she wears many hats. She has worked in corporate America and has owned her own advertising and PR agency. During her 15 year stint as an entrepreneur, she penned two books and wrote three plays that were produced in Atlanta. One of the things that she says that she has learned is that it doesn’t matter what all you accomplish, unless the end result brings you fulfillment.

Tune in to not only discover how to get that fullfillment but to also get strategies to stop missing out  on living your best life. My extra special guest is Dr. Lori Shemek. She just released her new book, ""How to Fight FATflammation!"" Dr. Shemek is no stranger to Fit4Life Radio and has been a guest several times, that's why I wanted to share this information with you becuase it is simply amazing! She will be talking about why she wrote the book and how it will help you fight fat and win!

Plus learn how you can get a FREE copy of her new book! And get to speak with her live on a special Google Hangout this coming Saturday.


From the book:

""Even If You Do Nothing Else: As soon as you wake up each morning, drink eight ounces of water. Then drink two eight-ounce glasses of water before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Drinking two glasses of water before each of your meals will boost your resting metabolism enough to lose five pounds a year, even if you do nothing else."" On Mechi Renee's website, you will find these statements: ""...help women take back their power. It is my own life goal to share my knowledge with you, help you address your personal challenges, and encourage you to build a more fulfilling and meaningful life.""

She realized she had to do the same for herself and got down to business! So far she has lost 26 pounds, 12% bodyfat and 22 inches. She joins us today to talk about how she did it and what's next in her life and she continues to inspire women to do more through her coaching practice. Words can hurt, but words can also heal. Today, our guest, Mary Ellen Ciganovich, shows us exactly how to use words to heal.

Mary Ellen Ciganovich is an educator, speaker and writer on the topics of Awareness, Spirituality and how these affect our life situations. She conducts a popular seminar called “Live, Love, and Learn” that teaches people how to take charge of their lives and control their health through the use of medical and alternative choices. You may contact Mary Ellen as a speaker for your group at askmaryellen.aol or 423.653.6446.

She has been a student of the Bible all her life, holding many Church leadership positions. She has also studied “A Course in Miracles”. “A Course in Miracles” is a spiritual form of psychotherapy that teaches you to utilize the power that is “Holy” within yourself to change your perceptions, learning from your problems instead of fearing them. Mary Ellen utilizes the principles taught in both of these throughout her presentations and writings."

Be heard at https://www.facebook.com/groups/LTGLCommunity/ LTGL 012 Andy Imhoff
 Andy is host of Boost, Booze and BBQ and Pardon My Fork podcasts.
Andy parted out a race car and had some money that needed an outlet. He had raced and even has trophies from doing that. 
He got tired of waiting for someone to contact him for an interview on a podcast and started his own. He did lots of research and found that “precious few items” would provide professional quality. He started in February of 2016. 
His most popular episodes were about food and it has grown from there. It keeps gaining attraction and followers and getting more popular all the time.
When talking with people about food, it’s visceral. It’s so tied in centrally with our brains – sights, smells, touch, sounds – it’s all so integral. Food is ingrained in us because it is so vital to life. 
Most people congregate around where the food is.  Sales tip – be near the food and you’ll be around the people.
As Andy says, “Food for thought and knowledge for life!”
He is hardest on himself. Most people are. “But it resonates so much with me. I thought it might be short term, I could sell my equipment and move on. And now I find I am shoulder deep in a journey to be more fully committed.” It’s time for me to do that. 
He was an 80 percenter. He is leaving that behind him now. No longer a status quo guy because it is a ridiculous self-fulfilling prophecy. Depression, crippling depression, was a part of his past.  He could accomplish things but it stayed in his life. He wanted to be happy. Not for the sake of being happy, it just wasn’t enough. He felt accomplishments left a bitter taste in his mouth. 
This is why I am so drawn to food. It’s such an experience of touch and feel. For instance, fire allows me to step out of a crisis. As Kim said, it is a form of meditation.
The smell, the sound, the heat of a wood fire brings back all the sensory and innate memories of this experience. 
Andy says that a great team building exercise is build a fire and cook a steak over it. Each person has their own steak. It is often done in corporate parking lots today.
Kim tells us about an experience she and her husband had about cooking steaks at the end of sticks over the fire. Then they ate the steaks caveman style. It was a memorable bonding experience.
Andy reminds us that about 60 years ago, people switched to indoor cooking. It was natural to cook outside over a wood fire.
Andy was invited to a massive event and opportunity. His wife insisted that they go. She overrode his self-denial and they went to the WFC (World Food Champs) event. It was a fantastic event. 
They became the last minute sou chefs. It worked for them because they are super competitive. And his parent s had a restaurant.
He relates a memory where he started the grill on fire. Someone was screaming, ”Fire. Fire” Instead of using a fire extinguisher, he leaned in and blew the fire out!  Much to the chagrin of his eyebrows.
We ended up with 3rd place in the competition. Usually first timers don’t do this well. We went to the final round and got 10th place. He explains the low placement being due to using a tortilla instead of a hamburger bun.
His “inner ham” came out. He jumped in front of the camera every chance he got.
For his show, he doesn’t do a lot of prep. He loves to explore the art of conversation. It makes for an organic conversation. Kim and Andy have fun, entertain and inspire. And shift perspectives.
Conversations should be embraced and not avoided. Andy says that he has found that his food show has allowed people to seek out the people that know what they are doing and are hands on. 
Being an independent food journalist means a lot to Andy. If it’s important to Andy, it shows.
Duck meat is one of the most underutilized proteins. It takes the smoke so well. Smoke it on the second rack in the smoker and capture the fat and the This conversation circles around selfies, social media, breast cancer, essential oils, the impact of the choices we make and much more.

Today’s Trivia:  How many selfies are posted each day?

Fabianna Marie of FabulouslyFighting.com was diagnosed at the age of 27 with Breast Cancer.  She's endured over 150 rounds of Chemotherapy, radiation, and a deteriorating kidney. She fights every day and has chosen to share her journey with the world through blogging and social media in hopes of inspiring anyone facing adversity.

She launched her first book in November of 2016. She has been a guest speaker at national cancer charity and fundraising events as well as part of a national ad campaign for the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer. She is also an award winning photographer, best selling author and writer and is a former model and entertainer. 

Along with her degree in Liberal Arts and Business she also holds certifications in Raw, Vegetarian and Vegan Cuisine, and is a Certified Holistic Nutritionist and aromatherapy Practitioner. 

Her company, Fabulously Fighting LLC, is dedicated to helping others live through adversity through love, laughter and honesty.

Fabianna’s life changed when she figured out that she had the choice on how to live and move through her life.  It wasn’t an overnight realization.  Over time she realized creating her ideal life was going to manifest through the choices she makes.

Her life is not sunshine and rainbows, living with metastatic breast cancer, but she gets to choose how she responds to the hard times.  

The name of her business came from someone describing how she viewed Fabianna’s journey.  
Her first book, Cancer is What I Have, Not Who I Am is a compilation of her blog posts about what she’s been going through or other life stories.  

In the beginning, everyone had their opinions about how she should treat her cancer (and also Lupus that she has been diagnosed with.)  She realized she wanted to control how she responded to her diagnoses.  When she realized that she could do her homework and learned how she could change things on her end, she realized that trusing her gut gave her power. Dr’s were giving her 5 years to live (she’s on 13 years as of today) she decided that she was going to take those years (vs being “given” them.)  She butted heads with her doctors, bringing in research about different therapies, diets, etc.  

Fabianna’s daughter, Mackenzie, was one year old when she was diagnosed.  She believes that if she had not taken control, she may have only lived the 5 years expected and would have missed out on so much of Mackenzie’s life.

Photography served as an outlet and turned into a career.  Now, she has achieved the level of Naturopathic Practitioner and is pursuing certification as a naturpathic doctor.  She is excited to use the knowledge that she gained in her fight against cancer to serve clients in her practice.  One of the areas that she works deeply with clients on is essential oils.

Essential oils can be so good for you, but you need to work with a professional, because they can be hazardous to humans and pets used incorrectly.  She is creating personal oil blends based on a clients holistic picture and having great results treating such conditions as bursitis, breast cancer, anxiety, depression, multiple sclerosis(MS.)

Trivia Answer: There are 93 million selfies each day, which would represent 2,583,333 rolls of film. 
According to Pamela Rutledge, director of the nonprofit Media Psychology Research Center.... Al Kessel is a full-time narrator and voice actor who works out of his professional home recording studio in sunny Arizona. He began several successful podcasts in 2010 and is a prolific audiobook narrator and has lent his voice numerous other projects, including apps and video games. He's not all work though... let's learn more about Al Kessel.
 
He likes to focus on the “good” stuff. Audio books weren’t where he wanted his career to go. But he loves books and always finds something appealing.
 
He never read a book in his voice. He always created a character voice to match his imagination of the character. His audiobook career spans the time since 2013. Before that point, it was doing podcasting with his wife. 
 
He had been doing the same job for 15 years, then he was downsized out of a job. He began his voiceover journey.  It got hard, but his wife encouraged him to stay with it, even when he would get discouraged.
 
Recording audio books means sitting for very long times – hours even. But even though you are all alone, you are talking “with” someone. Not just a cold heartless microphone. 
 
He imagines himself sitting around a campfire telling stories and his listeners are spellbound.
 
His philosophy? Every story deserves to be told. Every story. Every story also deserves to be heard.
 
Fun comes from hanging out with his posse- collection of figurines -  all around him in his studio. His cast of fun characters includes Buzz Lightyear and other fun characters.
 
Al and his wife love DisneyLand. Tales from the Mouse House comes from a visit to DisneyLand. The second he walked through the gates, he was a kid again. Then the ideas flowed. They did the podcasts for a couple of years. They thought people would want to know of the little hidden details and interesting things to do in DisneyLand. When they stopped doing it, there were about 75,000 downloads per episode.
 
Al says podcasting is an interesting medium. It is a great way for anyone to get their great ideas out into the world. 
 
It’s really about taking passions and monetizing them so that you can continue doing what you love. Because the key to success is doing something you are passionate about it. Your audience can always tell someone who is just reading a script to someone who is connecting with people through their passion.
 
Everyone faces times when they want to “throw in the towel”. Al had been used to having an idea and being successful with it. The voiceover industry doesn’t work that way. As this was unfolding, Al was 49 years old. He had been at a job for a long time. People don’t want to see these things on your resume. So, they pass you by.
 
He pulled his big boy pants on to give it his all. Al’s wife supported me with incredible grace. I knew if I could make a success of what makes me happy, we would both be happy.
 
Al says, “This was the best choice and decision of my life.” 
 
Al’s most memorable projects are – the first one was Out There. It was the life story about a 100 mile runner. He actually chose me to read his story out of hundreds of auditions. His book portrays his struggles with various addictions. He was really broken and had a heart attack. He left the hospital and started running. It is an inspiring story.
 
The other memorable book was by Dr. DisneyLand, Jeffrey Barnes. He wrote a couple of books. They are backgrounded in Walt Disney and the Disney parks to make his points. 
 
The non-fiction is where I get inspired and get involved. There are so many stories to be told in non-fiction form. Even the quietest mouse in the corner has a story.
 
A good life is doing something you are passionate about, something you love doing and sharing it with someone.
 
“When I look ahead, I would love to voice some animation and some video games. But my true love is... In this episode, Kimberly talks about her Money Fountain philosophy and ways to create a consistent, residual inflow of money to allow you to live a life of freedom and choices, whether you keep your full-time j.o.b. or not.

Ever had to miss work because you or a loved one were struck with injury or illness? Thinking about how you are going to be able to afford retirement? Want to create a life you don't need a vacation from?

Living Well with Multiple Sclerosis,"Welcome to the Overcoming MS | Living Well with MS podcast. In each episode, your host Geoff Allix will explore a different aspect of the OMS 7-Step Recovery Program in greater depth. New episodes will be published approximately once per month, and will feature interviews with scientists, fitness specialists, diet experts, stress reduction professionals and OMSers themselves. The podcast will also feature inspirational, real-life stories from people with multiple sclerosis about the daily challenges and small victories of successful lifestyle modification. Welcome to Season 2 of Living Well with MS and thank you for being part of our growing podcast audience. Thanks to you and listeners like you, the podcast’s first season was a hit, with audience stats that landed us in the top 20% of all podcasts out there. Please keep tuning in and spread the word. Regardless of how people hear about Overcoming MS, the important thing is that they hear about it, and Living Well with MS is an informative tool to help make that happen!
  
 On this first episode of our second season, we are pleased to welcome a very special guest to Living Well with MS, Dr. Valter Longo, the scientist behind the Fasting Mimicking Diet. Dr. Longo is a bio-gerontologist and cell biologist serves as a professor at the USC Davis School of Gerontology and as the director of the USC Longevity Institute. He is the creator of the fasting-mimicking diet, a low-calorie, low-protein, low-carbohydrate, high-fat meal program that claims to mimic the effects of periodic fasting. Despite the implication, this is a juicy and timely topic, so tune in to hear what Dr. Longo has to say. To read Dr. Longo’s full bio, click here.
  
 Questions:
  
  Thanks for joining us, Dr. Longo. Before we dive into your dietary recommendations, can you enlighten us a bit about today’s rising fascination with fasting diets? Tell us a bit about the fasting-mimicking diet and what you consider its primary benefits. What are the main differences between the fasting-mimicking diet and other fasting diets? What are blue zones? Your research shows that fasting mimicking can help people live longer, but can it also help people with MS live better? Can you tell us a bit more about 5:2, 16:8 and occasional water fasting, and is there a difference in effects between them? What should we eat between fasts? Can we drink alcohol? What is the Prolon diet? If people can’t afford Prolon, can they get some of the benefits on their own?

Our next episode is a special one, with one podcaster talking to another as Geoff Allix interviews Jessie Ace, host of the podcast, From DISabled to ENabled. Bio:
  
 Since the 1980s, Andy McKenna has been a dedicated mountain biker, spending his life poring over maps, dreaming and exploring the mountains of Scotland and beyond. Turning his passion for two-wheeled adventure into a multi-award-winning mountain bike guiding and tour business in 2008, Andy is an experienced mountain bike guide and reluctant administrator who along with his wife Aneela balance their busy working lives by making sure they both takes their 'medicine’ regularly, meaning together getting out of the office, into the hills on their bikes as often as possible.
  
 Andy has been living with MS without use of MS medication since 2007 and is the driving force behind ‘Stoked on MS’ (irony intentional) and through this hopes to shine a light of hope on the reality of leading a healthy, productive and active existence by adopting the Overcoming MS way of life.
  
 Questions:
  
  Can you tell us a little about yourself: where are you from? What do you do? How did you find your passion for cycling? Tell us a little about your journey to becoming an avid mountain biker. What is Go-Where?  How did your MS diagnosis change your relationship with your cycling passion? What did you do about it? What limitations has your MS introduced to your active lifestyle, and how have you dealt with or overcome them? What is Stoked on MS? How did you discover OMS and what has your experience been with its approach to MS management? What compelled you to dedicate some of your fundraising efforts to OMS (which, by the way, resulted in over GBP 70K in collective contributions to date)? If you had one piece of wisdom or inspiration to impart to someone newly diagnosed with MS, what would it be?

 Subscribe to this podcast and never miss an episode. We will be taking a few weeks off to celebrate the holidays, and we certainly hope you will too, though you can catch any episode of Living Well with MS here or on your favorite podcast listening app. We will kick off season 2 of this podcast on January 15, 2020 with a very special episode on intermittent fasting featuring world-renowned expert in the subject, Dr. Valter Longo. Till then, have a wonderful holiday season and Happy 2020!
   If you’re diagnosed with MS, your thoughts naturally gravitate to your own health and what you can do to improve it post-diagnosis. Once you’ve settled into a course of action and considered positive steps you can take to improve your health outcome, such as the OMS 7 Step Recovery Program, you might start thinking about your family. Given there is a genetic component to MS,  prevention in family members (and this doesn’t just apply to kids, but siblings too) is a vital topic when considering a comprehensive approach to MS management. In fact, prevention is so important that it constitutes an entire step in the OMS 7 Step Recovery Program. And there are specific  steps you can take to help ensure that your genetically-related immediate family steers clear of MS.
  
 Joining this crucial discussion on today’s episode is Lorna Wilson, who has firsthand experience with both MS and preventing it in family members. Lorna learned of Overcoming MS shortly after being diagnosed with Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS).  As a mother of three – with a love of family, food, travel and adventure – she enjoys life with family, friends and community. With a family keen on delicious food, the OMS diet keeps those she loves happy and well-fed while positively impacting her own health.  Lorna is focused on MS prevention and empowering her daughters to take measures for their future health and well-being.
  
 Questions:
  
  Tell us about the genetic component to MS. If you have MS and have children, how likely are they to get MS? How did you break the news of your diagnosis to your children? Have you changed how you act as a parent because of MS? What are they key factors in preventing children and family members from getting MS? If you follow the OMS program, should your kids and family members be following it too? Is it just diet or should they follow the other pillars? Should children follow the OMS diet to the letter? What do the numbers show in terms of reduced chance of getting MS if you are a child or sibling of someone with MS and you follow the OMS program? Teenagers can be quite rebellious in general, so what are some tips to encourage them to adopt the right lifestyle choices to aid prevention? How do you persuade children to continue with healthy practices once they leave home? Any other prevention tips for kids and family members of people with MS?   
 Subscribe to this podcast and never miss an episode. Please review our podcast on  Apple Podcasts or your favorite podcast listening app. On the final episode of Living Well with MS’ first season, we welcome Scotland’s own Andy McKenna, mountain biker extraordinaire, owner of a cycling trekking business called Go-Where and creator of the inspiring documentary film, Stoked on MS. Thanks to all our listeners for making Season 1 of Living Well with MS such a big success. We are excited to have you back for Season 2, launching on January 15, 2020 with a special kickoff episode on intermittent fasting, featuring world-renowned expert on the subject, Prof. Valter Longo. The holidays will soon be upon us, and we all know food is a big part of the fun. Whether it’s Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah, New Year or any other festive occasion that you may celebrate, this time of year presents the temptation of delicious meals whose ingredients don’t always fit the dietary guidelines OMS recommends. So how do you draw the line between keeping your palate happy come holiday time versus sticking to a diet that will keep you healthy?
  
 Well, that’s what we will discover by talking to Ashley Madden, a full-time food lover and health enthusiast. She’s a pharmacist, plant-based chef, certified holistic nutrition consultant and food photographer.  A diagnosis of MS in her early 20s triggered an overhaul of her personal and professional life and, ultimately, she traded prescriptions for plants! She shares her plant-based, gluten-free and oil-free recipes on her blog RiseShineCook.ca and creates recipes for health and wellness outlets like Forks Over Knives and Mind Body Green in addition to working on her first cookbook, to be released in the fall of 2020. Originally from Canada, Ashley has moved around the world over the last 10 years, from New York to the Netherlands, and currently she lives in Taiwan. You can learn more about Ashley and her taste bud-tempting work here and  here.
  
 Questions:
  
  Can you tell us a little about your background and your passion for cooking? How long have you been following OMS?  Has it been challenging to change your dietary habits? What are you best tips for making the transition to an OMS diet easier?   Holidays can be a stressful time for meal preparation. What is some overall solid advice for reducing that pressure? Lots of holiday meals are heavy on ingredients that are not OMS-friendly, like meat and dairy. What are some tips for making holiday meals that are consistent with OMS guidelines yet still delicious? Would your tips for making OMS-friendly holiday meals differ if you’re talking about cooking for large groups versus smaller more intimate gatherings? Let’s talk about some specific holidays to see if you have any special tips or meal ideas for these:  For our friends in Canada and the United States, Thanksgiving? Christmas? Hanukkah? New Year? Any other holidays come to mind that inspire any special advice?   If there is one nugget of advice from your experience with preparing meals that you’d like to impart to our audience in closing, what would that be?

 Subscribe to this podcast and never miss an episode. On the next installment of Living Well with MS, we tackle the vital topic of preventing MS in family members through a candid interview with from Lorna Wilson, a member of the OMS community who offers a firsthand perspective on taking the necessary steps to ensure her kids steer clear of MS. Navigating the range of medication choices for people with MS can feel like walking through a maze blindfolded. There are so many factors to consider – from effectiveness to side-effects – so we are fortunate to have Dr. Aaron Boster, an Ohio-based neurologist specializing in MS, as this episode’s guest to help demystify the sea of Disease Modifying Drugs that are presently available to manage the symptoms of MS.
  
 Dr. Aaron Boster is an award-winning, widely published and Board-certified neurologist who currently serves as the Director of the Neuroscience Infusion Center at OhioHealth. Witnessing his uncle’s diagnosis with MS when he was 12, he and his family came to see a lack of coherence in the way MS was treated at the time. That experienced informed Dr. Boster’s drive to do things differently. At OhioHealth, he spearheads a revolutionary model in MS treatment and patient care drawing on interdisciplinary resources and putting patients and families first. Dr. Boster is also an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Neurology at Ohio University Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, and a former Assistant Professor of Neurology at The Ohio State University, where he also formerly headed the Neuroimmunology division. Dr. Boster received his MD from the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. He also manages a popular  YouTube channel covering all aspects of MS.
  
 Questions in this episode include:
  
  What are the levels that neurologists talk about when referring to medication? What does it mean to a patient if they are getting a level 1, 2 or 3 medication? Can you describe some of the most commonly prescribed disease modifying therapies that would help someone with MS make the right choice? Do you think that someone with MS should start with the mildest therapy first and then work up to a stronger therapy if symptoms progress, or use the strongest possible therapy at the outset? Do the most effective medications always have the most side-effects?   
 Subscribe to this podcast and never miss an episode. The cascade of holidays is around the corner, and you’re probably already prepping your palate for some rich meals. On our next episode, join Geoff as he chats with  Ashley Madden about OMS-friendly holiday cooking tips, just in time to ensure your holiday meals will be healthy and delicious! Multiple Sclerosis is the focus of burgeoning medical research, which can seem like a scientific maze to the layperson. So on this episode of Living Well with MS, we are fortunate to have as our special guest one of the most qualified guides through the MS research labyrinth,  Professor Gavin Giovannoni.
  
 Professor Giovannoni is an academic neurologist based at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London. His current research is focused on Epstein Barr virus as a possible cause of multiple sclerosis, MS-related neurodegeneration, biomarker discovery and validation, and MS clinical outcomes. In his spare time when he is not busy pursuing new frontiers in MS research, Professor Giovannoni is an avid reader, blogger, runner, gardener, husband, father, dog-owner, cook and wine and food lover.
  
 Questions in this episode include:
  
  What got you interested in specializing in MS? In what ways have you seen MS clinical and research objectives shifting over the past decade? Do you see lifestyle modification as playing an increasing role in patient care? Why are  lifestyle factors so critical in managing autoimmune conditions such as MS? Has generally accepted clinical practice for MS care been slow to adopt some of the best practices in terms of integrating lifestyle modification into mainstream care that we’ve seen in heart disease, diabetes and certain forms of cancer? If so, why? What are the most promising research frontiers in MS today? What can we expect to see as possible outcomes of today’s MS research in the next 10-20 years? What’s the most  important advice would you give today to people newly diagnosed with MS?   
 Subscribe to this podcast and never miss an episode. Our next episode will feature  Dr. Aaron Boster, an Ohio-based board-certified clinical neuroimmunologist specializing in MS. Dr. Boster will discuss how to navigate the array of medication choices available for managing the symptoms of MS, and how to make the right choices. Be sure to tune in!"

Lizdom,"Approaching life with a growth mindset is at the core of these conversations. We can shape our world with health, fitness, and obtaining skills key in tuning in to our mentality. Join the conversation with Elizabeth Sullivan about Life, Purpose, Love and Business. Let's build a life you look forward to! Truly knowing yourself can have a great impact on how you go through life.
 In this episode the importance and benefits of knowing yourself is broken down into simple ""how to"" steps that you can apply throughout your day to increase your self awareness. 
 Once you know how you show up and function at your best it's a key piece of information to lean into and communicate to those around you. 
 How do you respond to the world?
 What are your habits and your thoughts? 
 What makes you laugh, angry, excited, or curious?
 There is great power in knowing yourself. In this special episode of Lizdom we are joined with guests Shelly Rock &amp; Jamie Haberl of the Iowa Healthiest State Inititiative to discuss Iowa's new Mental health awareness program, Make it OK.
 Make it OK is a community campaign to reduce stigma by starting conversations and increasing understanding about mental illness.
 Shelly Rock played a key role in Minnesota's Make it OK program before moving to Iowa a few years ago and found herself asked to help head the initiative in Iowa due to her prior key contributions.
 Jamie Haberl, Executive Director of Iowa Healthiest State Initiative, is heading ambassador training efforts across the state as well as connecting people with resources and information about the Make it OK program.
 Make it OK is here to help educate Iowans and get the conversations going:  -Start by learning what a mental illness really is. -Then find out what to say and not to say when someone opens up to you. -You can also help others by sharing your own story to help people know they aren't alone.
 To find out more information on Make It OK visit www.MakeItOK.org/IOWA or www.iowahealthieststate.com We all have a certain identity about ourselves that we align with, and that comes with a set of habits and routines that each individual incorporates into their life based on their perceived identity.
 In this episode of Lizdom you will hear from two inspiring guests as we discuss our nighttime and morning routines and what that standard for each of us individually consists of. 
 Terri Good and Lucinda Bryant are the first guests on this show and have SO much value to share! So grab your headphones and enjoy the conversation!
 Feel free to email your very own tips or questions to es.lluxuries@gmail.com Here are your dreams, handed to you in a sudden moment, are your ready for it?
 In this episode of Lizdom the question of ""are you ready"" is posed. If opportunity came today, as you are, current skillset &amp; all, would you be ready for it?
 ""Nature limits instant gratification for a reason. The rewards are sweeter when they are recognized &amp; worked for."" Time and Mortality are an inevitable fact of Human life. In this episode of Lizdom the importance of using your time for greater purpose is pointed. 
 Take it from an asthmatic who breathes like Darth Vader frequently, time is precious, what are you going to do with yours??
 *Podcast correction: The word Mortality was meant, though Immortality was what was said. Sorry for the confusion You have a gift, and you have a gift, and you have a gift.
 In today's episode of Lizdom we discuss discovering and highlighting those gifts in you and in others. All while acknowledging the presence of fear and doubts. The connection in vulnerability and the falsehood of perfection."

Sable femenino



Polémica: deniegan el visado a la venezolana Alejandra Benítez, por lo que no pudo participar en este gran premio. Denuncia a través de RRSS que ha sido por su adhesión al chavismo (ministra de Deporte). Tampoco se presentó Patricia Contreras, la otra representante del país. El comité olímpico venezolano llevará al COI una queja por lo que consideran una transgresión de la Carta Olímpica.



Olga Kharlan (UKR): número 1 indiscutible de FIE y olímpico, lejos del resto. Sablista muy completa, mano siempre en su sitio, tira con mucha tranquilidad. No falla: en este periodo olímpico su peor resultado ha sido un 7 puesto. En este Gran Prix ni la campeona olímpica Zagunis, ni Balzer, ni Tamura, ni siquiera Olga Nikitina pasaron de los 8 puntos; la única que se lo puso difícil fue la china Yaqi Shao, que hizo una competición excelente (Queroli, Marton, Stone) y onsiguió llevar a Kharlan al 14 iguales controlando mucho la distancia -sabiendo que quedarse cerca de la ucraniana es letal-, esperando a que se parara y terminara el ataque. Tocados muy justos. La final no fue tan justa: Kharlan rápida en mano y piernas, hizo de todo: paradas respuestas, contraataques, ataques largos, cortos…Olga Nikitina (RUS): la única rusa en el podio en una competición donde brilló la ausencia de Sofya Velikaya. Pero Nikitina estuvo a la altura: la sablista de 21 años arrasó hasta la final, gritando cada tocado, mucha intensidad y seriedad, sin especular. Fuerte en el centro y en el final de pista, dominio del tiempo. No dio ninguna oportunidad a Lembach en la semifinal (minuto en 8-2, 15-6). Mucha carrera por delante y posible líder mundial en unos años. Bronces: Charlotte Lembach (FRA), que eliminó en el camino a 2 de sus compañeras, Brunet y Berder en una competición muy completa de la sablista, y Yaqi Shao, que quizá era menos favorita que otras mujeres, realizó una competición muy buena con resultados muy ajustados. Españolas: sobre el papel, resultados modestos. Araceli Navarro pierde en t64 con la coreana Choi 15-9, falta de intensidad, pierde oportunidad de sumar más en un GP. Por su parte, buena actuación de Celia Pérez que gana en 64 a la también coreana Jiyeon Seo en un asaltazo de la española y Lucía Martín Portugués hace una remontada que se ha movido por Instagram: del 7-13 al 15-14 con la alemana Lea Krueger con tocados en el centro de la pista. Ambas pierden en t32 con Olga Nikitina y Jiarui Qian respectivamente, 15-8 las dos.Sable masculino



Podio formado por



Oro: Bolade Apithy (FRA). Tirador experimentado: 34 años. 5 en ranking FIE. Grandes resultados en Gran Prix: 14, 1 (Moscú). Buen periodo olímpico: siempre 8-16, pincha un poco en el mundial (33). Rápido, dominio del tiempo (ataques no, preparación, centro de la pista). En su camino deja a dos miembros del todopoderoso equipo norcoreano: Bongil Gu y Junghwan Kim, quien puso emoción con una rápida remontada, incluso llegando a estar por delante. A pesar de las molestias en su tobillo derecho (cojeando) llegó al 14 iguales (15-14, último: ataque preparación). También se le dan bien los italianos como demostró en semifinales y final: primero contra Luigi Samele (no tuvo oportunidad después del 8 iguales) y en la final Hoy traemos un tema polémico donde los haya: los árbitros, el arbitraje y sus pifias.



Muchos pensaréis que hablaremos exclusivamente de sable y florete, armas que, estaremos todos de acuerdo, quedan muy afectadas por un buen o mal arbitraje. Por eso os invitamos a aguantar hasta el final y descubrir un asalto histórico de espada donde el arbitraje ocasionó uno de los momentos más extraños de la historía de la esgrima deportiva.

Lobkes Podcast,"In deze show spreekt diëtist Lobke Faasen met inspirerende gasten over duurzaamheid, bewust leven, gezondheid, voeding, veganisme/plantaardig eten, compassievol leven, sport, lifestyle, spiritualiteit, mind set en persoonlijke groei. Luister, raak geïnspireerd en ontdek hoe je steeds zelfbewuster in het leven kan staan. Roanne van Voorst
 Roanne van Voorst is schrijver, journalist en antropoloog. Ze heeft 12 jaar lang onderzoek gedaan naar de sociale impact van klimaatverandering en heeft voor deze onderzoeken geleefd op plekken waar mensen nu al met de gevolgen te maken hebben. Zo leefde ze voor lange tijd in Groenland bij een jagersgemeenschap en later in een sloppenwijk in Jakarta.
 De afgelopen jaren is ze zich meer en meer gaan verdiepen in wat er nodig is om een klimaatcatastrofe te voorkomen en zo kwam het onderwerp dieren en bijproducten van dieren eten op haar pad. Ze schreef er zelfs een boek over: Ooit aten we dieren. Een boek waarin ze uiteenzet waarom de komende generaties met verbazing gaan terugkijken op de manier waarop 'wij' dieren behandelden, zelfs toen al lang bekend was dat dieren hieronder lijden en de productie van dierlijke producten een enorme bijdrage levert aan klimaatverandering.
 In deze aflevering praat ik met Roanne verder over haar onderzoek naar de sociale impact van klimaatverandering en het toekomstscenario van de bioindustrie. Ze vertelt over de boeren die nu al stoppen met het houden van vee, omdat ze het niet meer naar zichzelf konden verantwoorden dat ze bijdragen aan het systematisch de dood injagen van intelligente wezens met gevoelens zoals varkens, kippen en koeien. Ze schetst een toekomstbeeld waarin volgende generaties vol ongeloof terugkijken op deze periode van de geschiedenis, net zoals wij nu vol ongeloof terugkijken naar de tijd waarin slavernij, vrouwenonderdrukking, het verbranden van heksen of in het openbaar roken compleet normaal was.

 Ik heb inmiddels al heel veel gesprekken gevoerd over voeding. Ik heb veel stil gestaan bij de manier waarop onze voedselkeuzes onze gezondheid en de gezondheid van deze planeet beïnvloeden. Maar ook ethische vraagstukken omtrent het huidige voedselsysteem zijn aan bod gekomen. Deze aflevering gaat ook helemaal over gezondheid, duurzaamheid en ethiek, maar dan niet omtrent ons voedselsysteem maar omtrent de fashion industrie. De kledingindustrie heeft namelijk een schrikbarende impact op onze planeet en de gezondheid van mensen.
 Om dieper te duiken in de problematiek omtrent deze industrie ben ik in gesprek gegaan met Marije Douma. Marije volgde een mode-opleiding in Amsterdam, maar raakte helaas teleurgesteld in het wereldje eromheen. Daarom deed ze voor lange tijd afstand van de industrie en werkte ze in een museum. Maar het werken in het museum wakkerde een bepaalde drive bij haar aan. Musea zorgen namelijk goed voor bepaalde spullen, zodat de komende generaties er ook nog van kunnen genieten. En dat is wat Marije ook wil voor de wereld. Dat onze kinderen en kleinkinderen ook nog op een mooie aarde leven.
 Om deze kernwaarde tot uiting te kunnen brengen, opende Marije in 2016 haar winkel RecycleKid. Een winkel met kleding en speelgoed voor kinderen, waar alles tweedehands is of gerecycled (zowel de producten als het interieur). Daarnaast inspireert en helpt ze vrouwen om op een leuke en verantwoorde manier de kledingkast te verduurzamen.
 In deze podcastaflevering praat ik met Marije over de impact van de kledingindustrie en hoe je als consument de meest verantwoorde keus kan maken. Marije vertelt welke keus de beste is voor deze planeet, de mensen uit de fashionindustrie en je eigen portemonnee. Daarnaast geeft ze volop tips om duurzaam inkopen te doen zonder in te leveren op stijl en kwaliteit.

 Op veler verzoek luister je in deze elfde podcast naar een gesprek tussen mij en een arts. Walter Bouwmans is huisarts met een eigen praktijk in gemeente Middenmeer (Noord-Holland). Toen hij een aantal jaar geleden een bijeenkomst over leefstijlgeneeskunde bijwoonde, viel bij Walter het kwartje: artsen zijn voornamelijk bezig met symptoombestrijding en geven maar weinig aandacht aan leefstijlfactoren. Dit was de aftrap naar een zoektocht in de literatuur. Want wat is dan precies een gezonde leefstijl, met name een gezond voedingspatroon?
 Hij startte met een koolhydraatarm voedingspatroon, iets wat hij ook op zichzelf heeft toegepast voor een periode. Hier viel hij wat kilo's mee af, maar dit gewichtsverlies stagneerde op den duur. En dat was het moment om nog eens verder te kijken in de literatuur. Zodoende stuitte hij op de overtuigende bewijzen dat een voedingspatroon waarin planten de hoofdrol hebben de gezondheid optimaal ondersteunt.
 In deze aflevering staan we stil bij de vraag hoe een (hoofdzakelijk) plantaardig voedingspatroon je gezondheid maximaal ondersteunt. Maar een veel groter deel van de aflevering praten we over de praktische kant van deze kennis. Hoe is het om arts te zijn in een wereld die gedomineerd wordt door farma, terwijl dat zelden oorzaken aanpakt? En de nog veel grotere uitdaging: hoe krijg je een patiënt die geïndoctrineerd is door cultuur en industrie zo ver om het voedingspatroon te veranderen?

 Lisette Kreischer is één van de grondleggers van de vegan movement in Nederland. Al sinds haar 10e is ze vegetariër, rond haar 20e besloot ze veganist te worden. En het bleef niet bij het uitvoeren van de leefstijl. Met 10 boeken op haar naam (en de elfde in de maak), een eigen vegan burger (de Dutch Weed Burger) en twee blogs is Lisette met recht een plant activist te noemen. Haar missie? De plant weer de rechtmatige plek in de wereld teruggeven en de spotlight richten op de mogelijkheden die planten hebben als hoofdingrediënt in de keuken én ondersteunend aan onze gezondheid.
 In deze aflevering praten Lisette en ik over haar eigen duurzame reis. Wat maakte dat zij op zo'n jonge leeftijd al geïnteresseerd raakte in een leefstijl waarin ze in harmonie leeft met Moeder Aarde? En waar haalde ze de vastberadenheid vandaan om zich zo te verdiepen in een leefstijl die toentertijd nog helemaal in de kinderschoenen stond (om nog maar te zwijgen over het feit dat haar omgeving daar niet altijd in faciliteerde). Daarnaast hebben we het over hoe ze steeds weer nieuwe boeken de wereld in trapt, wat voor haar persoonlijk de grootste mijlpaal was in haar carrière én hoe ze de toekomst van deze planeet voor zich ziet.

 Patrick Kicken had aan de buitenkant alles goed voor elkaar. Hij werkte jaren bij de grote radiostations Radio Veronica en 3FM, draaide als DJ op diverse feesten, verdiende super goed, had een mooi huis en kon in principe alles doen wat hij wilde. En toch was hij degene die een burn out kreeg. Hij was ongelukkig met het leven wat hij leidde en ging op zoek naar de ware zin van het leven. Hij zei zijn carière bij de radio vaarwel en stortte zich helemaal in non-dualiteit, bewustzijn, de vrije wil en het ego.
 Inmiddels heeft hij al ruim 10 jaar de podcast  praten over bewustzijn met filosoof Paul Smit (wat het tevens de langst lopende podcast maakt van Nederland). Daarnaast heeft hij nog de podcast  leven zonder stress, waar  ik zelf laatst ook te gast was om te praten over plantaardig eten, gezondheid en duurzaamheid.
 Aansluitend op dat gesprek besloten we ook een aflevering op te nemen voor mijn podcast. En dat resultaat kun je nu beluisteren. We hebben het over Patricks weg naar een leven met meer zingeving, hoe hij bij non-dualiteit terecht is gekomen en waarom hij er achter kwam dat een gelukkiger leven gaat om meer kwaliteit en minder kwantiteit. Daarnaast staan we uitgebreid stil bij het ego en de rol die het ego - volgens hem - heeft bij de vele uitdagingen waar we in de 21e eeuw mee te maken hebben.

 Linda van Roij is bioloog en aardwetenschapper. Ze doet voor de Universiteit van Utrecht onderzoek naar hoe het klimaat in het verleden gedijde aan de hand van fossiele algjes uit sedimentkernen. Met deze informatie wil ze achterhalen hoeveel warmer het nou echt wordt bij een verdubbeling van de hoeveelheid CO2 in de atmosfeer. Deze informatie is immers cruciaal om te bepalen hoeveel er nog mag worden uitgestoten om de aarde leefbaar te houden.
 Hoe meer Linda te weten kwam over de mate waarin aarde wordt verwaarloosd voor heb- en gemakzucht, hoe meer ze zelf de drang voelde om in actie te komen. Ze wilde duurzamer leven en daarvoor uitzoeken wat écht zinvolle manieren zijn. En deze duurzame ontdekkingsreis kan je al 3 jaar volgen op haar blog Zaailingen.
 Sinds de start van haar blog heeft Linda al veel veranderd. Ze eet 95% plantaardig, koopt zo veel mogelijk tweedehands en heeft een hoop spullen de deur uitgedaan. Maar als reisverslaafde is de meest aangrijpende keuze wel geweest om in principe niet meer te vliegen. Haar reislust is ze daarentegen zeker niet kwijt. Inmiddels is ze een fanatieke en uitgesproken treinreiziger die alle hoeken van Europa (en zelfs een keer naar China) per trein ontdekt.
 In deze aflevering hebben Linda en ik het over haar eigen duurzame ontdekkingsreis en hoe de blog is ontstaan. Daarnaast staan we uitgebreid stil bij de impact van reizen en waarom ze het radicale besluit heeft genomen om in principe niet meer te vliegen. Daarnaast deelt ze al haar treintips, vertelt over de voordelen van reizen per trein en legt uit je hoe je tot aan Azië kan reizen zonder een vliegtuig in te stappen.
