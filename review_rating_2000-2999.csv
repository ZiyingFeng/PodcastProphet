The volume is low, and there is so much echoing and background hissing and other noises, that it makes the voices hard to understand. After about 15-20 minutes, I had to just turn it off.

Great podcast - I love the idea of keeping the episodes relatively short to match the length of a workout. I will be happily sharing this podcast as a great resource to introduce high intensity training to people looking for a safe, efficient, and effective method for exercise. Inspiring and Informative Podcast - actually makes me want to be healthier! I heard about inform fitness thanks to Gretchen Rubin and I have been looking for a fitness routine I could do long term that would work with my busy schedule and after listening, I think I found it. Very excited to try this! Glad You’re Back! I discovered “The Power of 10” when Adam’s book was first published and it quickly became my workout “bible”. The podcasts keep me motivated to stay on my slow strength training program. Keep ‘em coming! Awesome Podcast Adam, host of The InForm Fitness Podcast, highlights all aspects of fitness and nutrition in this can't miss podcast. Adam and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens! I want to love it but... I can't understand it. I'm not a weightlifting nerd. I loved Adam's book for its well organized simplicity. If only this podcast could be the same! Instead they ramble on with so many asides and so much peripheral information that I completely loose track of what their talking about. They ask each other yes or no question (not what good interviewers do) and then give long winded answers but never a clear yes or no. They often have women on the show but they get about 1/10 the airtime of the men. The guests are impressive and knowledgeable and this could be a GREAT podcast they just need more planning and a better editor. Tons of information This is a solid podcast, packed with good information. I was curious about Inform Fitness after reading about the science of this method and then hearing Gretchen Rubin recommend it on the Happier podcast. Listening to the podcast convinced me to give Inform Fitness a try. I've had 3 sessions now and I was sold after my first session. I've run 13 marathons and countless races at shorter distances, and this efficient workout is kicking my butt! I highly recommend both the podcast and the workout! Entertaining & Educational I've listened to all the episodes and every one of them is packed full of valuable information and tons of fun. I love when Adam and his friends geek out on bio-mechanics, nutrition and the power of habits. The energy of the show is playful, light hearted, humorous, and at the same time very educational. I train with Joseph at the Toluca Lake location and he exudes that same energy. I'm menopausal and have had insomnia for many many years. Super Slow (Power of 10) training feels like it is resetting my circadian clock. I have a huge release of ""feel good"" hormones during and after my weekly workout. I've tried many different forms of ""exercise"" and this is the one that I actually look forward to. I challenge and push myself to see how far I can go by using my jedi mind power. A New Way to Look at Fitness The InForm Fitness Podcast is a great, easy listen. Adam, Mike, Sheila, and Tim do an excellent job of laying out the methodology of the InForm workout, as well as discussing how their method applies to fitness training in general. If you're interested in wellness on any level - or just curious about trying something new - this podcast is a terrific introduction to learning more about the science and psychology of working out, and figuring out which training philosophy is right for you.

Love listening to your podcast but a more advanced one is something I would really be interested if there is enough of a following. Regardless I never end an episode not learning something new and I can’t thank you enough for that Gavin. Favorite podcast! Such enlightening podcasts! Hosts are great and their speakers are very knowledgeable in their respected fields. Great advice to those recovering from tbi as well as anyone interested in neuroscience. Excellent & valuable resource I stumbled upon this podcast a few weeks ago and I’ve been hooked on it! Cavin’s personal account of his experience with brain injury is phenomenal and definitely inspiring. As a TBI survivor of 11 years myself, this podcast has helped me in gaining a better self-awareness and understanding of the types of resources available to me. As a newly graduated PTA who desires to have a career focused around neuro-rehab, this podcast is an invaluable resource for understanding the whole patient process from the clinician’s view point. Thank you to all involved in providing this outstanding and informative collection of interviews. Best Podcast for TBI Survivors After suffering a mTBI, I felt lost at home unable to do anything really but listen to podcasts. Searching for answers, Cavin's podcast was the most helpful - and the most human. It's not only full of technical information from leading experts in brain science that will help you in your recovery, its also a lot of fun and will make you smile. Take a look, you won't be disappointed. Thanks, Cavin! Hope I lost my eyesight due to an anoxic brain injury from a pregnancy compilation. I spend every day asking my smart speaker for information about brain injury. I stumbled upon this pod cast and it has changed my life. It has given me motivation and hope. Because of this pod cast I am enrolled at Revive Treatment Center and am looking forward to further healing. Thank you! A Beautiful Creation As one listens to this podcase, Cavin's authenticity, knowledge, and light shine through brightly. In his viewpoints, I see a lifework that is building beautiful bridges between compassion, healthcare, and healing with food...pulling together the best of all three to bring joy back into lives once thought of as over. Keep shining Cavin!! Every TBI survivor should listen in! I am just over four years post subdural hematoma which resulted in a mild to moderate traumatic brain injury. I remember asking every healthcare provider I saw about ways to recover. I bounced around to different docs who all put me on various prescriptions and not one of them offered that I would get better. I wish I’d had this resource back then! I’m a big fan of Cavin and his work. After reading his book I finally started the keto diet, which has reduced some of my head pain. I’m looking forward to pursuing more therapies and diet improvements thanks to recommendations from the podcast.",50,10

Thank you, Laura, you rock! -Emily A must listen for all mamas to be and mamas in general! I was born and raised in humboldt and recently moved away. I am a doula and aspiring midwife. I love this podcast it gives me a little taste of home when I’m needing it and is an awesome Inspiration. I love all the birth stories and it’s so fun to hear people’s stories that I might have not heard in just plain conversation with them ♥️ Awesome podcast This podcast has to be my favorite podcast! I look forward to listening to it each time it comes out. It's so honest and raw and as mothers we need that. We need to know we are not alone.

This podcast gave me hope while I suffered with chronic pain. It helped educate me and now after 25 years on opioids I am free. Incredibly Informative with Charming Hosts This podcast is a lifesaver! Anyone suffering from a chronic condition can learn and benefit from the thorough, fun, and inspiring interviews. Cory and Ian (hope I spelled their names right) are so charming, and you can tell in their voices how much they enjoy exploring different peoples’ lives and journeys with cannabis as medicine. A must have for anyone using this plant to heal in any form or method. Love this Station My mom has stage 4 breast cancer (spread to bones and other areas) for about 3 years now. She has recently began taking the oil via suppository and has felt such pain relief and energy. She opted out of conventional. While my mom has alot of work to do I truly believe that Cannabis Oil is a blessing and will eventually cure her. Praying for everyone going through this horrible disease! Great podcast ! Thanks so much for all that you do. I thoroughly enjoy listening to your show and am constantly directing others to do the same. Very powerful information about an equally powerful plant. Be well. Best podcast ever! This is why I now believe in the medical benefits of cannabis! I was against it until I found this one day and began listening ! Thank you for this!!
