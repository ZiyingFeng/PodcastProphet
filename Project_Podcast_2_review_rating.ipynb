            "['I really like listening BUT It’s depressing how much he bounces back and forth with his weight and seems to constantly make excuses as to why he keeps gaining weight despite the podcast before he talks about making better decisions or something similar. The guy is very relatable and I enjoy listening but it seems like he doesn’t really want to lose weight. Also it seems like he is just advertising atomic habits the last several episodes and not really giving any other kinds of advice.', 'Great lessons on weight and life ', 'Love this podcast I love Dave’s honesty and relatability. He’s the kind of guy you’d want next to you in the trenches because he’ll make you laugh despite the miserable struggle. His podcast not only motivates me to lose weight but his podcast is rich with nuggets about life that have proven very effective. His skinny weight loss jingle is the highlight of my morning commute. True he’s not always successful at losing but he’s managed not to gain and has consistently followed s mostly healthy lifestyle, which is impressive. Again I cannot express how much I appreciate is honesty and his willingness to be vulnerable in an effort to help others.', 'This motivates me Dave is a highly relatable and funny guy and above all he comes across as very honest and highly transparent and trustworthy. It is true that he is moving back and forth on his journey to find his path to fat loss for life, but I prefer this 100x times more than a fake Dave that would just tell me what I would like to hear. I think that what makes his podcast so relatable is that I can find my own struggle in his honest sharing of his own struggles in his personal journey. And he has a very funny way to bring accross his point. I was once paying a monthly subscription for another motivational health podcast that I also liked a lot, but than it turned out that this guy was not telling the complete truth about his own journey and progress, but was only recording what he thought that his subscribers wanted to hear. Eventually I guess he was getting into this conflict of interest and he was sharing only worthless nothings and fillers up until people starting seeing through and cancelling their membership and the show was cancelled a few years ago. I would rather pay Dave 2x more very gladly, to support his show, which I am actually doing to a certain extent as a patronizer, than give this other podcaster even 1 dollar for his fake podcasts. Did I mentioned that Dave is very funny? Dave keep it up. I will continue frantically check my podcast app weekly to see if you have any new honest and truthfull motivational podcasts for me to listen to while I am doing my exercises on my journey to find my own fat loss path and beat my own struggles with my overweight. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!', 'I like this podcast I’m down 90 lbs since July and your podcast helps me. Thank you!', 'As a Health and Wellness Coach Been listening for several years and really enjoy Dave.

He's just you're regular guy. Things happen, his weight goes up, life goes on. You just gotta pick yourself back up & get back to eating right & exercising. This podcast has helped inspire me & over the course of several years I've lost 75 pounds. I was well over 400 pounds & I still have a ways to go. And I've been able to encourage others, like my mom who's lost around 100 now. Keep up the great work & just know you are inspiring people.\", 'Logical weight loss I have listened to this podcast for several years. I absolutely love it. Why? Because Dave is perfect? Because Dave has all the answers? Nope, because Dave is like me and he is honest about his struggles. While I am totally rooting for his success, I know that some day he will get there and this podcast will end. I will feel like I lost a best friend. However, while he is still here, I am a faithful listener.', 'Awesome!!! I am not sure I agree with everything Dave says but he is honest and says he does not expect us to agree with everything. A lot of weight lost podcasts have experts have been fit and in shape for some time, Dave helps me see the real side of things, he even admits to having a hard time with soda like me. Listening helps me reflect on my own process. I also love that he talks through what works and what does not work for him. When it comes to losing weight I lose focus fast, Dave is great at telling us about new web sites or motivational tricks that I can try when I am losing strength.', 'good podcast I enjoy walking to the podcast!! I am fighting the same battle with similar obstacles. Keep them coming!', \"Need more So glad I found this podcast. It's just what I needed.\", 'Get with It really enjoy the podcast just wish it was more frequent', 'The King of Excuses Really enjoy your podcast! So real!!

I like the gadget tips and the fact that David Jackson goes though the same struggles as everyone else. I am looking forward to more podcasts. Keep it up!', 'Would you like some pity in your party I like the guy - he seems like a really good person. However, for the entire time I\\'ve been listening to his podcasts, he has puttered around with about a 10 lb. range - this over 2 years or so. He is addicted to Mountain Dew and the entire gist of his shows is to review some web based food and exercise tracking systems or fitness \"aids\" or iPhone apps. The bottom line is, I need somebody that motivates me by example. Dave seems to be doing this podcast just to listen to himself talk. If that is the purpose of the podcast, I think there are plenty of others that have moved past the \"eat less exercise more\" mentality. And the difference between them and Dave is, their approaches actually work.', 'Great tips! ', 'Inspirational ', \"Oh boy. . . This is such a comforting podcast. The world needs David Jackson. I listen to him because he is going through similar challenges around weight loss and he learns right in front of us. He's a regular person whose podcasts sit with me for years after he produces them because he's doesn't pretend to be a guru, he's himself. When i am feeling lonely and need a friend, this is the podcast I turn to every time. btw, Great information about new weight loss gadgets!\", 'Horrible.... So let me get this straight. There is a premium group that costs money to join. Putting it gingerly the host beats him self up and whines about lack of weight loss for good portion of the show. So if you are looking for otivation keep moving to another podcast.', \"I like it a lot I found this podcast not very long ago and have really enjoyed listening while I'm walking, mowing the lawn, or driving. I find Dave to be very motivating and entertaining. Your tips are helpful and you have been motivating me to dust off my Fitbit and get those 10,000 steps in each day. Thanks!\", \"Like listening to a friend I like Dave. I find him inspirational and interesting. The fact he struggles with his weight makes him more like the rest of us. If your listening to his podcast it's obvious you have had issues with weight. I know I have had. I like his anecdotes and stories he finds on the Internet. Keep up the good work!\", 'Thanks Dave! I began listening to the podcast in 2014, because I wanted to change things. But I find that Dave is still stuck in that same yo-yo dieting phase. I subscribed because I wanted to have motivation and be inspired about losing weight. Instead I’m listening to a guy who hasn’t conquered his Mountain Dew demon and dogs others on weight loss surgery. I’m not a fan of weight loss surgery but the last 2 podcast that I listened to mentioned the diet shake that he’s doing as well how his friend was going to fail because she was going to do weight loss surgery. He was negative about it but didn’t mention any positives to motivate her or be empathic to her. So no, I can’t listen anymore because he’s Oscar the grouch in human form.', \"Are you reading my mind? It's worst than listening to a whiny little girl. What a complainer, can't stand his voice and constant interruptions. Maybe that had something to do with losing sponsorship from Amazon.\", 'I want to like this show but...

There are lots of podcasts out there who have already lost all their weight, and now they're trying to tell us how to do it. So if you don't know what you need to do to lose weight, you might prefer one of those. But the reality is that most of us already know HOW to do it, we just lack the motivation needed to do it. Dave is right in the middle of the same struggle that I am, so I really relate to him -- including his issues with Mountain Dew and his constant struggle with staying on track. That's me, except with more of a sweet tooth problem than a craving for Mountain Dew. :) Dave is just a regular guy trying to lose a few pounds while dealing with all the normal stresses of life, and that's someone I can relate to and want to hear from.

Thanks and keep up the fantastic work.', \"After this commercial break... This podcast is fun, motivational and educational. I love the energy. Dave is a normal guy, living a normal life who also has a podcast. This podcast is FULL of helpful little tidbits. Ones that I have found extremely helpful in my own life. I also like that he reads so much. Then gives a review. Saves me time. lol This podcast just rocks. I did have to dock Dave one star because you have to buy a membership to his site to hear past episodes....but....we all have to make a living. No shame in that...however, I'm keeping my star :) Keep'em coming Dave!\", 'No more excuses! I\\'m so glad I found this podcast. Dave is a real guy living in the real world, talking to us about how he works his weight loss on a weekly basis. I like the way he just puts it out there, how he can tie the weight loss struggle to events happening (like the Super Bowl podcast), I even liked the podcast where he took us for a \"walk\" with him. He said if he could do his podcast in the 20-30 minutes it took him to take his daily walk, then we could fit walking into our daily lives. Dave - real guy, real world weight loss, funny, conversational, no preaching, no stupid plans. You\\'ll be glad you gave him a little time out of your busy day!', \"Hi Dave I love this podcast!!!
