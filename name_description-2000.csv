 I am down to 224.8 ( a .6 lb loss). Not great, but its better than going up. 
 Brittany Runs a Marathon Review This is a fun comedy with some serious undertones. I really liked it. Ladies this has some other things that you will connect with that as a guy didn't connect as much, but I can still appreciate it. 
 I really love one part of the movie where her friends are not being supportive, and you finally start to see Britanny start to stick up for herself.

 Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken! This movie gives you a glimpse into ""Big Chicken"" and the lovely US government. I really loved the movie as it clues you into marketing jargon that tricks us into thinking things are healthy when they are not. This is not an ""anti-chicken"" in a ""we are killing chickens"" kind of way (the moviemakers seem to understand you need to kill them to eat them). You do see where these birds are raised and bred to gain so much weight so fast that they often have heart attacks - and that is seen as a good thing.

 see www.supportthisshow.com I started the year at 225.3 and after losing a few pounds, I'm back to 226. This is partly due to me going out of town for the weekend. I tried to do things like skip breakfast and I even exercised one day. None the less my scale went up when I got home. With this in mind, I got up today and exercised early. 
 MY NOT SO LUCKY GREEN SUIT
 I had to wear a suit to a speaking gig and I hadn't worn a suit in a while. To make a long story short none of my suits fit. I'm at least 20 lbs heavier than I was when I last wore a suit. 
 The fun part of this is there is only one person blame. I was not a fan of myself at that moment. I took that time and turned off my phone, TV, computer and just took some time to embrace how bad this felt. I DO NOT WANT TO FEEL THIS WAY. It hurt. 
 WHY CAN'T WE GET UP TO EXERCISE
 To get to Boston I had to get up at 5:30 AM which is EARLY for me (very early). Yet, when the alarm went off I got up in a slight panic, took a shower, finished packing, and got out the door on time.
 WHY? Because I had to. I had one shot to make my flight. If I missed my flight, I didn't have the money for another ticket or fee to get another ticket.
 WE NEED TO KEEP THE SENSE OF URGENCY
 We need to think of the opportunities we have to do the right thing as a plane. We have ONE SHOT to get it right and embrace that urgency and do the right thing. 
 NOTHING feels as good as watching the scale go down on a consistent basis. No taste gives you that feeling. 
 You're smart.
 You know the lies we tell ourselves.
 Quit listening to the lies. 
 You can do hard things (you do every day).
 Consider me your uber driver here to take you to the airport to catch the plan to onederland.  I started the year at 225.3 and after losing a few pounds, I'm back to 225. It's frustrating. I was doing good, but by skipping a few days and not really paying attention to my calories, and not exercising they came right back.
 The other thing that is killing me is a lack of sleep. My ears ring all the time and have for years, but for some reason, it's starting to affect my sleep. When I set an alarm to get up an exercise it takes an Olympic effort to get out of bed.
 It seems unfair that I can work for two weeks straight and lose two lbs, and stop for two days and gain it all back. The reason it seems unfair is because it is. You know what else it is? Reality. We have to find a way to deal with it.
 LOSING WEIGHT IS HARD BUT THESE MAKE IT EASIER
 STOP DRINKING YOUR CALORIES
 I started finding myself drinking the occasional coke, hot chocolate, etc. If you can stop drinking calories, you will be amazed at how that will boost your efforts.
 STAND INSTEAD OF SIT
 Standing desks have come down in price (they use to be around $1000 and now some are under $100 with electric desks coming in around $300).
 According to Jillian Michaels standing burns 1.5 the number of calories. If sitting burns sixty calories, standing burns ninety. 
 AVOID CHEAT DAYS
 The idea is to have a sustainable life. We try to be good Monday through Friday and then on the weekend we indulge and when we do WE GO ALL IN and erase all the work we did during the week. 
 BUT ITS SO HARD TO BE GOOD 100% of the TIME
 If we can be good 80% of the time we will make progress. You want a hamburger? Fine. Have a hamburger but skip the fries and the coke. You can have both. 
 You want 80% of the calories you consume in a day to be better view calories. The Noom app does this. There are green foods (eat as much as you like), Yellow Foods (Be cautious), and Red Foods (WARNING!). You want to avoid the Red foods, and keep the yellow food in check. You are looking for balance. 
 By using the 80/20 rule you are not depriving yourself 100%. Sure there will be things you have to postpone, but the ability to enjoy one item can take some of the dread of dieting, and the same of dieting, and make you feel a bit normal.

   Weigh-in: I'm up 1.6 lb back to 225.3
 I skipped a workout (typically every other day) and said, ""I'll just end up doing two workouts back to back days."" In other words,"" I""ll do it tomorrow.""
 So I did and I'm here to tell you my body doesn't like it. In the long run this won't work. So this episode is for me to listen in the future to remind myself that as hard as it is getting on my exercise bike, getting off I always feel proud with a boost of momentum to start the day. 
 Building Self Discipline
 An article in Entrepreneur stated
 

  Know your weaknesses Remove temptations Set clear goals and have an execution plan Build your self-discipline Create new habits by keeping it simple Eat often and healthy Change your perception about willpower Give yourself a backup plan Reward yourself Forgive yourself and move forward  I didn't know ""captain obvious"" worked for Entrepreneur magazine. 
   I was reading an article and it had a great plan. 
 Track your feed for 10 days and look at those days where your weight maintains. Then take the average of those days and subtract 500 calories. 
 So if you had
 2100
 1900
 2200
 1950
 2300
 1876
 2400
 1911
 2145
 1978
 The average is 2076 
 Subtract 500 calories and you get 1576 calories per day.
 The key to this is to take the calories of the days you maintained. Guys don't want to go below 1500 calories and Women shouldn't go below 1200.
 ONE MEAL
 I had ""Christmas"" last weekend as my brother goes out of town and the meal put 2 lbs on me the next day. For me looking back, a strategy would've been to:
 Put the food away after the meal. 
 Get the cookies off the table 
 In general, out of sight out of mind. Especially if you keep telling yourself, ""OK, this is my last one..."" then you know you are having an issue. Get it out of sight. 
 
 Mentioned in this Episode
 What Is a Calorie Deficit, and How Much of One Is Healthy? 
 Healthy Wage 
 Noom App 
 Try the free CSS beautifier lets you easily beautify stylesheets for your websites. Weigh In First things, I'm down .3 lbs. Not a huge win, but not a loss.
  
 Currently, the Noom app is giving me Green, Yellow and Red foods.
  
 The Most Addictive Foods
 Interesting article on the most addictive foods (hint its not broccoli)
 Eat Yourself Sexy 
 I found an interesting show called Eat Yourself Sexy on Amazon Prime, and while the show has some ""meh"" reality TV isms, I liked that you can spot what OTHER PEOPLE are doing wrong. Watch an episode or two and then go into your kitchen and pretend you're on the show.
  
 I also thought it was interesting that in 8 weeks women were losing 2 dress sizes and those that exercised (in addition to changing their diet) lost 20 lbs in 8 weeks (amazing what a little focus can do).
 Rolling Your Muscles?
  
 I bought a Doeplex Muscle Roller Massage Stick and I'm not sure it really does anything. I tested by just rolling my right leg, and so far don't feel any large difference.

Looking Up with Max McCoy,"On the journey of trying to live a healthy, meaningful & intentional life. Sharing as I learn along the way. Episodes will touch on psychology, performance, entrepreneurship & more. My name’s Max McCoy. I’m a 24 year old freelance content creator from Los Angeles, CA. I felt let down by the traditional schooling and how it prepared me for the life I dreamed of living. Ever since, I have been on a mission to learn from people, books, and experiences that can help me become the fullest version of myself. I’m humbled to be sharing these conversations and perspectives along the way, while hopefully growing alongside you. Welcome to Looking Up!  Sad week it is. This episode is compiled of some of Kobe's former interviews where he shares insights on his wisdom. RIP to my first hero.
We grew up with Kobe. The local superhero. Completely invincible. The highest ideal of what actualized potential could look like.
It’s one of the reasons why this tragedy is so unfathomable. -
With friends and family we can remember countless memories centered around some classic/crazy Kobe moments.
Even as we got older, finding a fellow die hard Kobe fan was finding a friend. Cut from the same cloth.
Where I grew up, sports was like our religion and Kobe was a God-like figure. Losing someone who we associate with superhuman capabilities is a gut wrenching feeling that makes no sense.
I’m sick for the family and the people who knew him personally.. But I find some comfort knowing that we’ll all only further ingrain what he’s taught us into our being b/c of this.
I find some comfort in the quick exchanges and fist bumps with strangers wearing purple and gold, knowing that this single human and all he stood for is still bringing us closer together.
I’m comforted by the fact that Kobe has lit yet another fire under my ass to live out my potential while im still here breathing because tomorrow isn’t promised .
Coming from Southern California, from basketball, this hits the community deep. I’m comforted knowing the world mourns together on this one, and the legend lives on.

LoopPraat - Dé Nederlandse Podcast over Hardlopen,"LoopPraat is dé Nederlandse podcast voor hardlopers, door hardlopers. Elke maand bespreken hosts Anton-Jan Thijssen en Tim Baks samen met een spraakmakende gast het laatste loopnieuws, delen ze tips en geven ze reviews. Jelle de Boer, artiestennaam DJ Snelle Jelle, is een muzikaal multitalent. Draaien, optreden, producer, docent op de Herman Brood Academy; slechts enkele zaken waar hij zijn tijd mee vult. Lang ging het leven in de entertainmentindustrie en sporten niet samen. Totdat zijn vader ziek werd en hij zelf vader werd. In deze LoopPraat vertelt Jelle waarom hij juist toen z’n hardloopschoenen aantrok en waarom en hoe hij er inmiddels zoveel plezier aan beleeft. Gewoon een klein uurtje ouwehoeren over hardlopen, geniet ervan tijdens het lopen, of bij het uithijgen op de bank.







Show notes:







* DJ Snelle Jelle op Instagram* DJ Snelle Jelle website* Maandelijkse podcast op Mixcloud Nick Klaessens dronk graag. Veel. En vaak. Totdat hij het genoeg vond. Hij zocht hulp. En ging lopen. Dat laatste ging goed. Nick liep de halve marathon en werd toen uitgenodigd voor het Boost 2 Berlin-project van Runner’s World. Een project waarbij drie verschillende lopers gevolgd werden in aanloop naar en tijdens de Berlijn Marathon. Met Nick praten we over zijn hele traject van drinkend op de bank tot aan het leven als loper en schrijver nu. En wat was de rol van Eliud Kipchoge in dit geheel? No human is limited…







Shownotes:







* Runner’s World Boost 2 Berlin documentaire* Berlijn in plaats van Bier Na een succesvolle semi-comback (hier) zijn we terug in de studio. In deze vijfde aflevering neemt sportdiëtist, wetenschapper en auteur Saraï Pannekoek plaats achter de LoopPraat-microfoon. 







Anton-Jan en ik wilde Saraï al enige tijd geleden in de uitzending hebben, maar vanwege omstandigheden ging dat toen niet door. En misschien maar goed ook, want er zijn in de tussentijd meerdere dingen gebeurt die perfect zijn voor LoopPraat. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan de Netflix-docu Game Changers, waar Saraï als sportdiëtist gespecialiseerd in plantaardig eten natuurlijk meer context aan kan geven. En de fysieke en mentale misbruik van de Amerikaanse toploopster Mary Cain door Alberto Salazar gedurende haar tijd bij het nu opgedoekte Nike Oregon Project trainingsgroep. Maar we trappen LoopPraat-aflevering 5 af met advies van Saraï voor Anton-Jan om zijn neerwaartse spiraal te doorbreken. 







En wat betreft vochtinname: 40 ml / kg lichaamsgewicht.

Luister LoopPraat-aflevering 5 met Saraï Pannekoek via onderstaande player of jouw favoriete podcast-app zoals Spotify of Apple Podcasts. Anton-Jan en Tim zijn terug en bespreken in deze aflevering waarom ze in hemelsnaam ruim vijf maanden geen nieuwe aflevering hebben gemaakt. Ook blikken ze terug op de afgelopen maanden en hebben ze het over Kipchoge en Sifan.







LoopPraat aflevering 4 bevat een ratjetoe aan onderwerpen maar uiteraard met hardlopen als gemene deler.







Show notes







* Anton Jan Thijssen op TEDxHaarlem * TV-aflevering Kennis van Nu * The Why van Billy Yang* Adharanand Finn – The Rise of the Ultra Runners* David Goggins – Can’t Hurt Me* LoopPraat S01EP07 – José Vincente* Man, man, man, de podcast * Boven het Maaiveld* Hardlooppodcast De pacer* El Tarangu* Billy Yang Podcast – Jason Koop In deze aflevering van LoopPraat is Leslie Pangemanan te gast. In zijn overvolle agenda wist Leslie een uur vrij te maken om met ons te praten over de dingen waarmee hij zo druk is. Naast een gezin en zijn werk als eigenaar van / trainer bij een sportschool in Amsterdam Buitenveldert is het deze periode extra druk voor Leslie rondom de stichting Run4Schools. Namens die stichting, die Leslie in 2004 oprichtte, loopt hij in het paasweekend de befaamde Two Oceans Marathon in Zuid-Afrika.







We hebben het met Leslie Pangemanan over dat bijzondere evenement, over de stichting Run4Schools en over waarom het zo ontzettend belangrijk is dat kinderen kunnen sporten. 







Genoeg gelezen, luisteren! Oh ja, normaal zeggen we op het einde van dit stukje tekst én op het einde van elke aflevering “blijf luisteren, en blijf lopen”. Maar dit keer willen we die graag aanvullen met “blijf geven”. 







Luisteren doe je via onderstaande player maar ook via jouw favoriete podcasts-app zoals:







* Spotify* Apple Podcasts







LoopPraat aflevering 3 (seizoen 2) download je via deze link.







Kijk hier voor all LoopPraat afleveringen. In aflevering 2 van seizoen 2 van LoopPraat schuift Sameena van der Mijden aan.







Toen we aankondigden dat Sameena onze volgende gast zou zijn, kwamen er meer vragen binnen dan ooit. En nog meer ‘zoveel respect voor haar’-berichten. Dat respect zal te maken hebben met haar bijzondere ultraprestaties van het afgelopen jaar maar zeker ook met de moeilijke periode die Sameena had toen ze slachtoffer werd van een loverboy. Na die vreselijke periode begon ze met lopen. In een hele korte tijd ging ze van “die eerste zware 200m op sneakers” naar 183km bij een 24-uurs-race in Athene. Lopen bracht Sameena eigenwaarde, rust, structuur, plezier en nog zoveel meer. 







In deze aflevering hebben we haar al jullie vragen laten beantwoorden en natuurlijk ook die van ons. Veel plezier met luisteren, en knoop het motto van Sameena in je oren: Let never, ever anyone tell you that you can’t do something.







LoopPraat luister je onder meer via Spotify, Apple Podcast en Soundcloud.

MAC MARTINS PODCAST,"Exercise daily for at least an hour. You do not have to kill yourself from running, jogging, etc., but you should have some sort of moderate physical activity in your everyday life. If you're looking to shed a few pounds fast, do a higher-level intensity workout. For example, go on a walk at a brisk pace for an hour. Working out at home has obvious advantages. But there are obstacles, too: distractions from the phone, the kids, the dog, the Internet and the refrigerator can derail a workout. And that's if you can get started in the first place.

 Episode summary
 
 Why fat loss to improve body comp is beneficial for sport and athletes
 -relative strength (power to weight ratio), sprinting, CrossFit
 -more of what does work, less of what weighs you down.
 -weight class sports - what about 'weight moves weight'?
 -appearance - it matters. 
 
 1. Headspace
 Don't let it get to your head. 
 ""I'm in a Calorie deficit, therefore I'll lose strength""... Will you really though? 
  Don't do dumb diet s**t', and you'll be fine.   
  
 2. Lifestyle &amp; stress management
 Manage your stress bank account  
 -Spend well - training &amp; life stress - seek efficiency with how you spend your 'stress money'
 -Save well - sleep &amp; leisure/downtime- deposit into your 'stress account' often. - basics &amp; sleep hygiene. Do something that you can relax with, it's easy on the mind &amp; body
 
 3. The actual diet
 Eat enough - hit the sweet spot, only go as low as you need. 
 Avoid LEA - implications on health and performance can be serious. 
 Importance of planning and timing. 
 A more conservative Calorie reduction with a slower rate of fat loss might be a better idea. 
 Eat enough protein to maintain 'muscle that does work'.  - Total protein, &amp; protein frequency &amp; distribution. 
 Ensure sufficient food quality - whole food quantity &amp; diversity, 400g+ veg, 300g+ fruit, a logical portion of whole grains and mostly unsaturated fats (mono &amp; poly) provide examples. 
 
 4. Adding in 'hacks'
 Carb timing - Bolus pre-exercise, consider timing, food selection and comfort. 
 Caffeine - Higher doses when you need it, 3-6mg per kilo, consider comfort, provide examples. habitual for training blocks. 
 Use the CHO rinsing &amp; the placebo of the sweet taste. Diet Cordial 'fake BCAA mix'. 
 Won't cause harm, so if it makes you feel good, it might be a placebo hack that's worth it.  Ep 52. Eating for happiness w Shannon Beer Whatever goal you have, in terms of nutrition, once you peel it back there are some common and goal-specific principals and 'things' that need to be in place rather consistently for you to progress. 
 
 In episode 51 of the Macabolic Podcast, I'm joined by all 4 of the Fortitude Nutrition coaches.
 
 If you're sick of the fluff and want someone to give you an overview of the things that are relevant to your goal. This episode is for you. 
 
 We start with common traits, then delve into specific traits of fat loss, muscle growth and sports performance.

Mark Heiman Podcast,"Investing, staying fit, and living life with Mark Heiman and his guests. We have been wanting to do this podcast for awhile and finally found the time! Laura, Laura's friend Caitriona, and Caitriona's friend Grayson step into the studio to discuss Rock climbing. Grayson has been rock climbing for over eight years, and Caitriona is not far behind him. We discuss the basics of the sport as well as a scary free solo story. Corey debuted on my podcast on episodes 8 and 9, but we didn't have a chance to talk specifically about his job at Edward Jones, the economy, or stocks in depth. We cover all of that, plus he tosses a joke or two in per usual. Last weekend, I sat down in person with Chris and Brandon to discuss the apps they have coded and the path they have gone down during and after college. They went from coding YoEats in our Mifflin house to Brio, to Care Pool, and finally to the new app and business they are currently building. We talk through the entire process and timeline from our Junior year until now. 10th podcast and it is awesome! Last podcast (8) + Daniel. First time having 4 people all at once, another fun in person podcast! Corey and Pat are in town for the Iowa vs Wisconsin game, so I set up the podcast studio and poured them a few glasses of crown (and had some CBD). Daniel wasn't quite to Madison, so we did another podcast with him after (going to post that one next after I edit it). Topics include: Haley and Pat get a flat tire in rush hour traffic, Corey's thoughts on the economy, and a bunch of nonsense in between. This is the first podcast I have posted that has been in person (Joe Rogan would be proud). Pat is back for his second episode, and we talk through three ways in which you can enhance your body and mind. I have never tried Cryotherapy or Infrared Saunas before this weekend, but Pat has raved about both to me, so I had to give it a try. Why not throw in a float tank and do all three in a single day."

I hosted a free training on this topic and this episode is a sneak peak at this training.

This episode is all about how to set an intention for your year that will serve not only your life but your business too.

In der Regel trainieren wir ca. 5 Stunden pro Woche, manche kommen auf 10 Stunden, aber weit darüber hinaus kommt niemand. Der Großteil der Trainierenden legt genau auf diese paar Stunden einen großen Wert, aber was ist mit den andere 158 Stunden. Eine Woche hat immerhin 168 Stunden. Herzlich willkommen zu einer neuen Folge des 10minuteMonday. Heut geht es um das Thema Ernährung. Explizit um die Grundlagen einer gesunden und ausgewogenen Ernährung. Gerade in unserer Reizüberfluteten Welt ist es schwierig, welcher Ernährungsphilosophie man glauben soll und genau das bringt uns zum ersten Punkt

PODCAST PRODUCTION BY POD PASTE  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy As the end of the year approaches most of us will likely start reflecting on the year that was and set new goals or “resolutions” for the year that is to come. Well, we’re taking you back to what we think is an important concept that will help you achieve your new year goals and live a joyous and full life.


In this episode, we revisit Stoicism. Stoicism is a philosophy dating back centuries and is still very relevant to today’s living. It is the flip side of what you all know as goal setting but presents another angle towards reaching your objectives in the new decade.


Stoicism and fear setting in particular are cool models and lenses to run things through and even see what didn't work for the year so that you can plan to avoid those things moving into the new year.


It would be awesome if you could subscribe, like and share our podcast. You can hear us on Apple podcast, Spotify, Stitcher and Acast. We’re also active on all of our socials @masterofsomepod (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter) so please give us a follow, like, comment if you enjoy what we do. 


Also, all the cool music you hear in this episode is created by Daren. Check out all his tunes here. 


QUOTES
15:21 - ""Stoicism is an acknowledgement that we don't control and we can’t rely on external events in the world. The only thing we can control is ourselves and our responses to those events...what we think, what we feel, what we say and what we do. The world is going to throw us curve balls. Stuff is going to happen and we choose how to respond to that. So in every culture, in every religion, in every time, there has been a question of how we conduct ourselves and how we handle life vicissitudes."" - Phil Cross

Read full post here - http://www.darenlake.net/fitness/why-i-stopped-training-with-heart-rate/


How I use heart rate training now as more of a suggestive guide and how you can benefit from it.


Heart rate (HR) training is great for monitoring what's going on from a zoomed out objective point of view. I've found in my experience and through my discovery process (science-backed evidence, my own experience, and talking with experts around me) that it's not so great for knowing precisely what stimulus and stress you are putting on your body to see the gains you might be wanting.


What is Heart Rate Training?


As stated in Runner's world, ""Heart-rate training uses your heart rate or beats per minute (bpm) as a guide for intensity. Instead of training at a specific pace, you use a heart-rate monitor to train your cardiorespiratory system to work at a specific effort for a set amount of time.""


Age-based formulas, the Maffetone Method, and even going out and doing a max heart rate test are the best ways to determine your heart rate zones. You then go out and train in those zones. Depending on your objectives and your fitness level, it's that simple.


Why it didn't work for me


While I did this type of HR training and mainly the Maffetone Method for about 5 years I started realizing a pattern. I


 wasn't actually getting faster at the really fast stuff because I wasn't training hard enough. I'm the first person to say that most people train too hard, but I actually wasn't training hard enough on my hard days to provoke a response and stress my system which in turn, breaks it down and builds it up so I can be [Daft Punk Vocoder Voice] harder, better, stronger, and… faster. [/Daft Punk Vocoder Voice]


Read the rest of the post here - http://www.darenlake.net/fitness/why-i-stopped-training-with-heart-rate/  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy Welcome to Master of Some a podcast about Health &amp; Fitness served up as a metaphor for life. Since we serve health related metaphors for life, this episode is a cross release with another podcast that I’ve worked on in the past and focuses on mental health/fitness rather than physical health/fitness.


Please note that it’s not your standard podcast episode. Think more of Serial, NPR This American Life, Radiolab or Gimlet. There is an interesting story being told with heavy production, lots of music and sound effects, and more. It’s all around black stereotypes and fetishes, why we wear clothes, and how gender equality could be more of a thing if we all got naked. Yeah… super idealist with this one. I mean, I did take almost 2 years to produce one podcast episode… so it’s gotta be meta on layered on meta right?


Please enjoy and feel free to share this episode or the cool black dudes episode - it’s the same thing, with anyone that you think would get some value out of it.


Thanks and enjoy!


------ From The Words of Daren &amp; Cool Black Dudes Radio Podcast----


The full episode is finally here! If you like cool stories about taboo topics please enjoy this.


Please note - The episode while extremely informative, contains some foul language and adult content. Listener discretion is advised.


A Pod Paste, DLake Creates, and Cool Black Dudes Radio original investigative story about how a guy's very personal insecurities turned into something WAY BIGGER than his problems.


What turned out to be a quest for me to ""get over my issues with my flaccid penis size"" ended up becoming a journey that I'm still on to find equality in all of us. While I might be an idealist in my libertarianism (or ist) utopian ways I think there is some truth in people becoming more real and more vulnerable by undressing their fears and inadequacies and showing everyone ""hey… maybe my problems aren't as big as I thought"".

Welcome to digressions. A new podcast format brought to you by cool black dudes radio. Darren Lake and pod pace. That tells upfront unfiltered and sometimes uncomfortable audio stories and documentaries about racial and race related topics. I'm your host Darren lake. I have always been interested in the human body in particular why we put clothes on and why we aren't naked more like what is actually stopping us from just being naked all the time. I've also been interested in the psychology and social norms around why we as humans do what we do. 


But funny enough like most people in from my findings looking at you men in the western world I've always had a hesitation around the whole stripping down and skinning dipping naked with friends on a late summer's night. I've been with ladies before that obviously never saw me naked and I was OK with that and I've also been in the guys locker rooms and showering with nothing on and it got normal pretty quickly but the guys are just half the population. I couldn't cope with taking it all off in front of a group of women that I didn't know in a public setting and my fear went deeper than all women. It was a particular race in a particular place. White women here in Australia are just letting you know.

Audioc The last episode of the season and we finally find out if Phil finished the race and if he finished, did he finish in the time that he wanted?! The story is about co-host Phil's attempt and journey to race and complete a 100km Ultra Marathon trail run in the Blue Mountains, Sydney, Australia.


This is a slightly different type of episode as we time travel yet again but we go back through the past season and his journey and test if our theory's about training for something we've never done would pass or fail.


Listen on to rest to hear about the end of this intense race, lessons learned, and what Phil, Daren, and the Master of Some Podcast are doing moving forward.

We also dive into what our morning routines look like almost every day and share some other successful people’s morning routine. People have been sitting in hot tents and rooms since ancient times. This practice of sitting in hot rooms was often thought of as a spiritual purification and to be healing and cleansing on the body. In today’s podcast, we explore all the studied benefits of sauna usage and why this ancient technique has continued to be such a staple in many people’s lives including Finland culture in particular.  Tyler is an aspiring Naturopathic Doctor, who attends the National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM) in Portland, Oregon. In this episode, we break down all things detoxification and discuss why it’s so important to detox your body in a safe way. Tyler really brings nuance to the conversation around detoxification, dispels myths and informs you how to support your body with the detoxification process the natural way.  While we often promote HIIT training and strength training, we forget about the great benefits of simply just going for a walk. This episode is a powerful reminder of how beneficial adding in some extra steps to your day can be. We also share some ideas for how to incorporate walking into your daily routine."

Contact matt@obstacleracingmedia.com with questions or comments. Live from Boston, we have been able to get a hold of Shaun Provost, Andi Hardy, and Ang Reynolds. They were able to tell us what they saw and are continuing to see and hear up in Boston.
 Here is what we planned on airing and will still air time permitting.
 ___________________________________________
Nickademus (Nick) Hollon was the youngest finisher ever at the 135 mile Badwater. Now he is also the youngest Barkley winner ever. If you don't know what The Barkley Ultramarathon is, please look into so you can be amazed at this man's feats. We got to talk to Nick just a few days after his historic run where he became on the 13th ever finisher of this near impossible race.
  
   First you are going to hear from Fred Smith of SmithFest Events. They put on obstacle races, scavenger hunts, and other cool things that  adults to run around like big children. The folks up north had nothing but great things to say about their events so far so I thought you'd want to learn about them.
Ray Upshaw is not shy about voicing his opinion. Some of those opinions are not so nice. When he recently told me he wanted to make some apologies, you can bet I made time to see him. In this interview, Ray compares himself to The Grinch, amongst other things. 
 I will also talk a little about today's turbulent activities with Extreme Nation. Episode 44
 I spoke with Spartan Athlete Director Robert Coble when he was here in Georgia in early March. We talked about what an Athlete Director does and how Spartan is improving the points system for 2013.  He also told me what he could about Spartan athlete contracts.
 Before Sophie Pollitt-Cohen became the Director at GORUCK, she was an intern for TV shows, was published in a bunch of cool magazines, wrote a book, and worked at Tough Mudder. I thought it would be cool to have her on the show and talk about her interesting past, along with the future of GORUCK. First up, I welcome Sean ""Run Bum"" Blanton back to the show. Sean is an ultra runner who puts on races with what I like to call ""OCR Spirit"". He is back to talk about two races he just race directed:The Georgia Death Race and The Yeti Nightmare, and talk about how they went. 
 Next, I will play my interview with ""Start Line"" Sean Corvelle. He is the man who leads everyone through the hype andTough Mudder Pledge before every heat. You will hear what he did during my first Tough Mudder that turned me into a Sean Corvelle fan.
 Finally, I will play an interview I did a few months ago with Dane Rauschenberg. Dane has run a ton of marathons, written two books,  and has done very well on the speaking at marathon expo circuit. Along the way he has had a lot of distractors. One even went as far as to create a website disparaging his efforts.  I was really curious to find out more about him."

The Push, a Netflix exclusive documentary, follows the story of a man who broke his back and became paralyzed doing a massive 100-foot snowmobile jump. Despite all the challenges he’s going through, he never let it define his life and eventually became the first person to sit-ski and push himself to the South Pole. Produced by Jeffrey Allard, The Push is a super inspirational film about owning your reality and getting back up to achieve your goals. Jeffrey joins us today to talk about this moving film, the others he’s been involved in – including The Texas Chain Saw Massacre – as well as what’s in the works.

Twitter @megumiyogatokyo Welcome to Megumi Yoga Podcast! Hello, I’m Megumi. I’m a Yoga teacher who teaches in Tokyo.  This program is a guided meditation focused on breathing. In modern times, there are various meditations. But I can say, to focus on breathing is quite simple and one of the basic meditations.  I tell my students to concentrate on their breathing at the beginning of class every time. It makes us calm. And we can come back easily to right here and right now when we just focus on breathing.   This meditation can help to adjust the rhythm of your breathing. After the meditation, you will be able to feel how relaxed you are.   In commuting time, break time during work, before doing Yoga and when going to bed……you can do this program whenever you need the inner silence. Enjoy."

Mo Motion - The Podcast,"Maureen Holohan is a former college and pro basketball player turned entrepreneur, writer and director of Mo’ Motion Youth Basketball & Fitness. Mo' Motions blogs, podcasts and videos offer expertise, inspiration, training and excellence in youth basketball. ACL repair surgery is something that the orthopedic surgery community is just now beginning to talk about after decades of subscribing to the belief that it isn’t possible. The belief is slowly changing, in large part because of the groundbreaking surgical work of my guest on this episode, Dr. Gregory DiFelice of the Hospital for Special Surgery, Sports Traumatology &amp; Joint Preservation Surgical department. In this conversation we talk about about the approach surgeons have taken in approaching ACL surgery in the past, what he’s done to ask questions that nobody was asking, and how his steps have led to the reintroduction of ACL repair surgery that is proving to be highly successful. This is a very important topic to me because I experienced my own ACL injury and had to undergo surgery myself. 
  Maureen: So the body wants to heal...
 Dr. DiFelice: You’re darn straight, it does. It wants to heal everything and all we’ve gotta’ do is get out of its way and try and let it heal.
   Click here to download on iTunes ACL repair surgery is not impossible, surgeons have only thought it was for the past 30 years. Dr. DiFelice points out that it’s hard to overcome the long-held beliefs of any group of people. That’s what he’s discovered has been the case among orthopedic surgeons for the last 30 years. Efforts in the past made to repair ACLs instead of replacing them met with very low success rates, so the concept was abandoned. But his research has shown that those stats are the results of applying the same surgery to EVERY type of ACL injury. Taking a closer look enabled him to determine that the patients who did do well with ACL repair surgeries had a particular type of injury and revealed an option he felt deserved more consideration.
  Dr. DiFelice:  I’ve been doing this (surgery) for eight years now, I’ve done almost one hundred (now over one hundred) primary repairs, we’re running at well over 90% success rate, and I’m pretty much used to it.
  The orthopedic surgery community is starting to come around, so ask your doctor about the possibility of ACL repair surgery. There is only one way the promising possibilities of ACL repair surgery can become mainstream, and that’s for patients to ask their surgeons why they don’t do repair surgeries that are having such huge success rates. Then, surgeons who have not learned the new methods Dr. DiFelice has pioneered may begin to explore it as an option to add to their practice. But more importantly, many young athletes can potentially be spared the agony of a more invasive surgery they don’t need and athletic careers can be saved. That's what matters to me - and why I wanted to have Dr. DiFelice on the show.
  Dr. DiFelice: As you know, change is hard and we’re sitting on a situation here where three generations of orthopedic surgeons have been trained as their dogma that the ACL cannot be healed. So basically, I’m going against the Bible… you have to open your mind to believe that maybe there could be a different way, maybe they were mistaken.

Coach Pat Fitzgerald is well known as the head coach of the Northwestern University Wildcats football team. Taking over after the unexpected death of his predecessor at the age of 31, he was the youngest head football coach in the Big Ten Conference at the time. Coach Fitz has built the Northwestern football program into one that is about more than winning - it’s founded on the importance of character, teamwork, and the right kind of atmosphere in which students can not only win but also mature as human beings. In this conversation, we chat about Fitz’ childhood, how he was recruited to the football team at Northwestern as a student, and his coaching and team philosophy.
 How college recruiting has changed over the years. Back when Coach Pat Fitzgerald was recruited onto the Northwestern University football team there was no internet, no social media, and no high profile press coverage like there is today. And more importantly, there were no 3rd parties involved in the process. It was just the player, his parents, and the coaching staffs of his high school and the prospective college. With the changes in technology and the business world that have come to touch college sports, more and more pressure is being placed on future college athletes to look and play the part of a future star. Coach Fitz talks about the changes and how the Northwestern staff approaches recruiting - and it’s a lot more like the old days than what you might think.
  On recruiting:
 “The process is pretty simple… Number one: if you don’t fit who we are academically, we’re just not going to recruit you. Then number two: We have a set of values we believe in who fit who we are as a program and we try to investigate this as deep as we can. Number one is the young man’s attitude. What type of attitude does he choose to have? And that’s not a ‘some of the time’ question that’s an “all of the time.’... What kind of work ethic does he have? Is he willing to invest and understand that what I’m working for today I may not have that return on for a number of years or months? It’s not instant gratification.  That’s not the way the world works.  What kind of character to they demonstrate? Are they making the right choices when no one’s watching? Are they trusted by their peers and by their community?”  
   Click here to download on iTunes. What makes Coach Pat Fitzgerald’s recruiting philosophy unique? When it comes to college recruiting every college wants to have the best players. But how you define what makes the best players makes all the difference. Coach Pat Fitzgerald and his staff are not only looking for the players with the most talent or best high school stats. They are looking for the best team players, the ones who have demonstrated humility and responsibility. They want the young men on their team who have the ability to apply themselves for the good of the team as a whole, and will be there for their brothers on and off the field. In this conversation, you can hear how Coach Fitzgerald and his staff find young men who fit that description and why it’s a non-negotiable.
 Football orientation that is more than learning how to play the sport. When a new student comes into the Northwestern Wildcats football program, he goes through a series of orientation classes - and they have very little to do with how to play football and fit in as part of the team. Each student is taught a series of lessons about teamwork, study skills, college success, and how to handle the newfound responsibility of being away from parents for the first time. It’s one of the expressions of Coach Pat Fitzgerald’s greater concern that his players not only succeed on the field but also succeed in life - and in his mind, college success is one of the first steps in that journey. You can hear more from Coach Fitz as he chats with me on th Andy Borman serves as coach of the New York Rens, a basketball association that aims to develop exceptional student-athletes who understand and embrace the fundamental principles of basketball, develop good sportsmanship, exhibit positive athletic and personal conduct, and excels in athletic competition. Coach Borman has been with the organization since August of 2014 and in this episode, he shares his thoughts about how players can create their identity as a player, find their place on the team, and excel in their exact role within the team. I hope you take the time to listen. It’s a great conversation that focuses on how players can increase their value and up their game by creating their own identity.
 When a player is truly eager to excel in his/her role on the team they need the input of the coach. But it’s not always easy to get in a way that is helpful to the player. The coach is busy, working not just to help each player improve but also working to build a game strategy and plan that will actually win games. That's why the individual needs to take responsibility for his/her own growth as a player.
 In this episode, Coach Andy Borman shares the most important question an individual player can ask his/her coach to get the feedback needed for improvement - and how to ask it effectively.

 What parents need to understand about their child’s participation in sports programs. Every parent wants to see their child play, especially when it’s a program where a fee is required to be part of the team. But it’s an unrealistic expectation to think that your child will play every game, or sometimes, at all. In this conversation, Coach Andy Borman of the New York Rens shares what parents are actually paying for when they place their children on a sports team and why they need to do their part to make it the best experience for the player possible by engaging with the process. It’s a challenging but important topic that parents need to hear, so please listen.
  “Where they (parents) are customers, they are paying for a service. The thing I say to them is… ‘You are paying for the training, not playing time.’ And then I would just say, ‘He ain’t playing.’ ‘Oh, but I’m paying X amount of dollars…’  ‘Yeah, I said that in the parent meeting. I’m sorry. You must not have cared enough to show up just like your kid didn’t care enough to come to practice.  Not my fault.’... If you’re playing on a real team, playing time is earned. Nothing is given.”
  Developing yourself as a basketball player requires building on who you are, not who you aren’t. As Coach Andy Borman watches players advance through the levels of his program (the New York Rens) he’s eager to guide players in the paths that will most benefit them as an individual player. That often means helping them learn how to study the game, not just the star or big-name players. You can hear Andy explain what that looks like for various positions and types of players and how he followed that philosophy in his own career by listening to this episode.
  “The only thing I’d say to players is, I can’t tell you if you’re a student of the game. Do you really watch basketball? Do you watch it as a fan, cause watching it as a fan is different than watching it as a student, are you studying? And then, who are you studying?... You better watch people who are just like you and are successful… if you want to be a basketball, watch the basketball. But if you want to be a great basketball player, watch the players that are like you.”  
  Outline of This Episode  [0:24] My introduction of this part 2 episode with Andy Borman. [1:33] The most important question a player can ask their coach. [3:05] Andy’s experience in team sports as a kid. Andy Borman serves as executive director of the New York Rens, a basketball association that aims to develop exceptional student-athletes who understand and embrace the fundamental principles of basketball, develop good sportsmanship, exhibit positive athletic and personal conduct, and excel in athletic competition. Coach Borman has been with the organization since August of 2014 and in this episode, he shares about his own background, his experiences in sports as a kid, what he learned from his dad about sports, and the importance and power of the coach’s decision in sports. And be sure to stick around to the end when Andy shares the three best and worst things parents can do in raising young student-athletes.
  Here's his Dad’s advice to him in 7th grade: ""If you want to ensure that playing time is there for you, no matter what… you have to be the best player on your team. And it has to be obvious. Not obvious to you but obvious to everyone in the stands…. And if you’re not the best, now it’s coach’s decision.""
  What parents need to understand about Coach’s choice. Many parents feel that their input to the coach about their kids’ ability will get a better opportunity for their kid. It’s natural for parents to want their child to have every opportunity, but from a coach’s perspective, the kids have to be willing to work for the opportunity. They have to be willing to workout and hustle to become a better player because it’s the better players that get to play. But in the end, it’s the coach’s choice as to who those “better” players are. Parents need to understand that. Parents need to be willing to hear the truth if they ask the coach about why they are not playing.
  Advice to parents: ""I will never question the coach in front of my kid. I have no problem with parents talking to coaches, just don’t do it in front of your kids. Then don’t turn around and relive that conversation with your kid. It does no good.  You’re undermining the coach. You can do that, and then just know that it will get to a point where, whether it’s high-level AAU or high-level college when that coach will say, 'Get out and take your kid with you.' There are 100 different ways to get what you want. Anytime you make a coach feel they like they are invested, that they are a part of your kid's life, I think it’s better for your kid. And so if you’re not happy with your kid’s playing time then grab a ball, get up a little earlier in the morning, and go to the park. Because once again, if your kid was the best player, he’d be playing. If he’s not, then it’s coach’s decision.""
  Three of the worst things parents do in the lives of their student-athletes. One of the questions Coach Andy Borman was asked on this episode of The Mo' Motion Podcast was what parents do that are terrible for their student athletes.  Coach Borman was not shy about responding. He says that when parents run down the coach or make everything the coach’s fault, they are not helping their kids - they are giving them a victim mentality. When they don’t hold their kids responsible for their own actions or lack of diligence, they are not helping their kids. Find out more about the ways Coach Borman says parents sabotage their own kids’ success on this episode.
 Outline of This Episode  [0:20] Introduction of Andy Borman and this episode of the podcast. [1:46] Andy’s growing up years and his athletic pursuits as a youngster. [7:44] How Andy advises parents to allow their kids to participate in as many sports as they like and how his experienced helped him. [12:44] Andy’s best moments as a player in college. [19:50] The lenses through which parents and coaches look at players. [23:05] When should a kid enter A.A.U.? [27:49] How can parents accurately determine the skill level of their child? [41:10] Important values Andy b It was as recent as 1996 that the WNBA, the Women’s National Basketball Association was formed, and the first season began in June 1997. Since then, the WNBA has been the home for the best women’s basketball talent in the world. Among the brightest spots in that short history has been Katie Smith, the all-time leading scorer in WNBA history, Olympic athlete, and now coach.
 About people’s response to her accomplishments: It’s a little surreal. When you’re in something and you’re doing something you don’t think how big it is because you’re just doing your job. So sometimes, you’re like, ‘Oh, I did that.”... Honestly, it’s just more of a, ‘Wow!' You know, going down the road from where I came from and here I am and did all these fun things. It was pretty amazing.
 In this conversation, I chat with Katie about her growing up years, how she got interested in athletics, about her college and pro careers, and what she’s learning as she transitions into her new role as an assistant and soon-to-be head coach.  You will love what Katie has to say about doing her time as humble apprentice who is eager to learn the art of coaching, instead of just assuming she can make the player-to-coach transition.
 Katie was always the type who wanted to study, get things right and give the best effort whether it was basketball, school or dance. As Katie Smith grew up her parents allowed her to be involved in all kinds of activities, from basketball to dance class. In all those experiences there was very little expected of her except that she give it her all in every setting. That mindset served her well as she began to excel in basketball and move from high school to college. Katie and I chat about those formative years, the role her parents and brothers played in her development as an athlete and the way she learned to use her natural and learned skills as a player to dominate on the court.
 The mental game in basketball is important, but it can also be an exercise in overthinking. As we chatted about her career I was very interested to hear how Katie Smith dealt with the mental aspects of the game. I was surprised to learn that she felt that while it was important to think things through - watching film, learning about opponents, improving her knowledge of the things she’d face on the court - she also said that she had a tendency to overthink it at times instead of letting her instinct and natural abilities do their thing. You can hear Katie’s approach to the game (and life) from a mental standpoint in this great conversation.
 Moving from all-star player to coach - a natural transition. Katie Smith was a natural on the court, playing at a top competitive level for her entire career. It turns out she’s also making the transition from player to coach in a pretty natural way as well. While there are definitely challenges, she’s finding that the role fits her well and that her desire to motivate and inspire players comes to her comfortably. Here’s a bit of what she had to say about the transition:
  When it comes to basketball, of course, there are lots of things I have to learn on the coaching side, and you are always questioning yourself, whether you’re doing enough, or was it the wrong play call, or are you doing this - but it’s something that I DO know and it’s a little easier to grasp.... But I enjoy life.  Like, why not? I’ve been playing basketball forever, I’ve met great people, I’ve traveled the world, I have a great family - and honestly I want to keep growing and hopefully find a way to give back and kind of find that niche, you know because I’ve had so many people give to me and that the game has given to me and it’s like, how do I, now that I’m kind of done with the playing part, how do I use it? It’s fun but it’s also nerve-wracking.
  Outline of This Episode  [0:23] Maureen Women’s basketball has come a long way in the last 10 to 15 years, and Anita Kaplan Fiedel is one of the women who has helped it do so. This conversation with my friend is a touching look into what it was like growing up tall as a girl, how basketball helped her fit in and find her sense of purpose and identity, and what happens when a perceived liability is turned into an asset.
 A career of distinction and dominance in women’s basketball. Anita achieved excellence on the basketball court at every level. Even though Anita, who was 6’4” in eighth grade, was never the best athlete in the gym – not even close – Anita ran the paint with advanced footwork, I.Q., and a deadly hook shot that she practiced in sets of 100s in her driveway - a shot she made without looking so many times that her teammates nicknamed her “Radar.” Anita earned the highest of high school rankings in becoming a Kodak, Street and Smith and Parade high school American. We were on an AAU team in high school that drew hundreds of college scouts to our games. All 10 out of 10 players on our team received full Division I scholarships. During her career at Stanford University, Anita was an All-Pac 10 center on a team that appeared in the Final Four three out of four years and won a national title in 1992.
 Turning a perceived liability into an asset as a dominant force in women’s basketball.  ""I was tall from the get-go. By Kindergarten I was 4’ 11”. And my parents, my Dad who is 6’ 7” saw this opportunity and he said, 'You can either suffer and be the only tall girl and not make anything out of it, or you can put it to some good.' So I started playing basketball when I was 5, in the driveway with my Dad. And his thing was, just get out there and shoot, and shoot, and shoot, and shoot. He hammered it home, 'If you love something and you work hard enough for it, you can attain anything.'""
  What can replace such a distinguished basketball career? It’s hard to imagine following a basketball career like Anita Kaplan Fiedel had. How do you top it? How do you live the rest of your life knowing that the thing you loved so much and excelled at is a thing of the past? For Anita, it was not hard to find the right replacement for all of that success once she began to have children.
  ""Then after my MBA, I focused in finance and accounting and went to work in the finance and accounting world and didn’t enjoy that - even less than marketing. Then I had my three children. I was working when I had my twins, and felt like I was going to have a nervous breakdown because here is something that actually filled the void. Motherhood for me replaced basketball as something that I care so much about and am willing to put so much that I have into.""
  Outline of This Episode  [1:28] My introduction of my friend, Anita Kaplan Fiedel. [3:10] Where Anita grew up and what it was like being a tall girl. [5:11] The moment when Anita knew what she wanted and that she could achieve it. [9:15] Anita’s experience in AU basketball - what she learned and enjoyed. [14:58] The pressure of the college scouting process and why Anita loved it. [23:23] Anita’s favorite moment in her college career: a tournament at UNLV. [24:27] Highlights from winning the national title at Stanford. [35:00] What Anita would change if she could: try to have a life outside of basketball. [37:40] The thing that separated Anita from everyone else on the court.  Subscribe to The Mo' Motion Podcast.

Mo Primal Podcast,"Mo Primal is the low carb podcast that supports Paleo, Primal, and Ketogenic lifestyles.When it comes to the Standard American Diet (SAD), we are #AgainstTheGrain Welcome back to another episode of the Mo Primal Podcast.

In Episode 12, which is really like a MPP2.0 Episode 2, I have structure! :)

I start off with a ""news topic"" in the health and fitness world. This show brings you honey. I thought we knew everything there was to know about it, but honey is back in the news. Thanks to CNN, I bring you a couple sweet points of interest that really stuck to me. That was a pun. Did you catch that? Next!

I slipped. My diet took a dip. Not a dive; it wasn't major. Perhaps we can call it a worthy compromise? Have a listen and let me know if you agree.

As for the exercise of the week? Coffee curls. That's my morning workout. Don't move. Don't talk. Sip. That's what helps be become a human for the rest of the day. Gym time happens later. You might guess the real ""Exercise of The Week"" by the title, but in case it escaped you, I discuss stationary rowing.

The recipe? Yeah, you're gonna have to listen to find that out. Some people may get a hint from my Instagram feed, _moprimal , but the rest will need to pan through the podcast to find out this delicious tidbit.

Thank you so much for being here. It means the world to me.

Cheers,

Morley After some down time, and a bit of reflection, the Mo Primal Podcast is taking a little bit of a different direction. Check it out, and let me know what you think. Do you like where it's heading? Are you taking supplements? Did you know that you may be throwing money away that could be better used by just buying real, healthy food?
Surely, there are several companies out there that are actually producing quality supplements and vitamins, but it has been brought to light that there are actually some big name brands that are holding out. So much in fact, that they’ve been ordered to stop producing and selling some of their products!
Without strict regulations in place, it is seemingly easy for someone to suffer from taking herbal supplements. This can happen through allergies. Imagine having an allergic reaction to something and you can’t narrow it down, because of the lack of information provided. How do you combat something like that?
Check it out as I break down a few samples of deceit in Episode Ten of the Mo Primal Podcast I get into the little ""sciency"" bit of what a carbohydrate is, as well as a closer look from a dietary standpoint. 
And, as is what seems to be becoming a theme, a little update of Mo Primal At Home. A bit of an update with what is going on around the home that is becoming a homestead. Then on to the main topic of the podcast, Dietary Fat. A brief look into Saturated, Polyunsaturated, Monounsaturated, and Trans Fats. When it comes to looking after yourself, it's important to know what you're putting into your body. Now that I have the space, at home, I am turning to gardening. Growing my own vegetables should be a no-brainer, but that doesn't mean that there isn't a lot to learn. 
This is exciting!"

Mojo for Running,"Mojo for Running Coach Debbie Voiles presents training principles and advice to help runners of all levels make wise training decisions. Topics include training schedules, base building, tapering, cross training, speed work, race strategy, running form, stretching, nutrition, drills, motivation, and injury prevention. It’s that time again, time to carefully consider what we should do in 2020 to take our running and our lives to the next level. Since the options for running resolutions are almost infinite, I thought I’d provide some insight into the advantages of some types of resolutions and the pitfalls of others.

In this episode of the Mojo for Running Podcast, I discuss goal of more miles than you’ve done before, the goal of a longer distance than you’ve ever run before, the goal of maintaining a running streak, and the goal of aiming for a PR. 

Beyond that, we’ll look at other kinds of goals I recommend you pursue, non-running goals.

Above all else, you need to set a meaningful goal. Some will plan to do 2,020 miles. But, why? Seriously, it’s just a number that happens to be the year, but what would be your reason for wanting to do that number of miles? 

Please give this some thought. Besides being meaningful, your goal should be reasonable, achievable. Then, you should start thinking about the process goals you’ll need to achieve to get you to your goal. Hopefully, this episode will give you some ideas and guidance. No time of the year challenges your commitment to running more than the holidays, the weeks between Thanksgiving and the new year. For that reason, I thought I’d share some my perspective in the hope that it will motivate you to stay the course. You, of course, may not run ‘all the miles,’ and I sure get that, as I explain, but you don’t want to let go of too many of your planned miles. 

Let’s talk about that.

To help with accountability, to give you just a little bit more of a nudge to stay the course, in this episode, I explain the Holiday Running Challenge I have planned for you. It starts, today. Are you in? Whether you are new to running or you’ve been running for years, there will be times when you stop running weeks or even months. Matybe you have a health issue, and maybe you had an injury. My runners miss long periods, sometimes, maybe due to caring for elderly parents, maybe due their own medical problems, and sometimes a running injury or some other injury that requires a long recovery period.

Sometimes, it’s weeks of overtime or school. Three of my runners in the last half dozen years, have missed more than a year when working on their doctorates. All came back, but it wasn’t easy.

And then, there’s the more common situation that I liken to falling off a diet. You know how, sometimes you’re being very careful with sticking to eating reasonable portions of healthy food, but then Thanksgiving rolls around, and you decide to let yourself go a bit for the holiday weekend, thinking that you’ll return to your healthy ways right after the weekend, but then Monday rolls around, and you find it’s too easy to just decide to wait one more day before getting back on the healthy eating bandwagon, but then Monday turns into Tuesday, and pretty soon, you’re saying to yourself, “Oh, well. I’ll just enjoy myself over the holidays and get back to my normal smart self after the first of the year.”

Well, sometimes running goes that same way. You take a week off, maybe due to going on vacation, planning to get right back out there on Monday, but Monday turns in to Tuesday, and so it goes. Before you know it, three months have passed, and with every passing week, you think about how much harder it will be than it would have been if you’d only been on a month-long break. Now, you’re less motivated because you realize how hard it will be.

No matter the reason, you know you need to return to running. I hope this podcast episode will help you ease back into a smart, consistent running schedule. Recently, Hubby and I actually went to a theater, which we hadn’t done in over a year, to see the movie, Brittany Runs a Marathon. In this episode I discuss that film, and, knowing that it will inspire many, that leads to the topic of running goals and running your first marathon.

No worries, I don’t give away the plot. I hope you’ll listen, and in this episode, since I talk about running ‘your’ first marathon, I also suggest that you listen to the four-part series I did on running your first marathon. Yes, it took four episodes of this podcast to sufficiently cover that topic. They are episodes 55, 56, 57, and 59.

In this episode, I also invite you to my race, the Run Tampa Tinsel Run, on December 21st, at Al Lopez park, right here in Tampa. I would love to have my listeners participate.

The race will be gnome-themed this year, and besides finisher medals, we’ll have age group awards, three deep in 5-year increments, and those awards will be gnome figurines. You’ll love them. The finisher medals will be, a gnome ornament. You’ll want to collect them every year; so, don’t miss this first one.

Below is a picture of the artwork that will be on the shirts. Here is a link to register. We’re capping registration at 500; so, register right away. Whether you live in the area or are visiting from out of town, it would be great to have you.  Even before you were a runner, you had probably heard the oft repeated line, “Running is 90% mental.”

I don’t think I’ve ever heard any long-time runner argue against this, because you realize pretty quickly that this is true. iF your mind wills it, if your heart is in it, if you have the necessary grit, the you will become a runner, and you will achieve the goals you set. It may take time, and it will certain require more mental tenacity than physical. This is what non-runners do not understand.

In this podcast, I pick apart the reasons why it is so mentally difficult, sometimes more than others, of course. You may not always realize the true cause of your mental struggle. I hope that understanding the root cause will help you deal with the mental side of running, and that will lead to greater success in every area of your running journey.

In this episode, I mention The Human Race, and Velma Radloff, in particular. I hope, if you haven’t seen the documentary yet, you will. Here are a couple of photos of Velma. Velma is 81 and still running, of course. How is your running base coming along? This is one of the most critical considerations for any runner’s success, but in my experience, the great majority of recreational runners ignore it. With this episode of the Mojo for Running Podcast, I hope to raise awareness to motivate every listener to give this area of their running life the attention it deserves.

A great percentage of your running success – or failure – will be due to a properly executed training, but if you miss a key area of training, no amount of effort to the remainder of your training will make up for the gap. It’s that important. 

By base, I mean the number of miles you run per week. If you keep a record of your miles – and most runners do – then go to your log book, right now, and see how many miles you were averagjng, per week, at the start of your last training cycle. 

This episode is likely to change your attitude about this often neglected factor that plays a critical role in your running success as regards the effectiveness of speed work, your success in avoiding injuries, and your comfort all the way to the end of races.

Your training base is that important.

**In this episode, I mention my son’s new podcast. His name is Ben Voiles, and his podcast is The Internal Work. I hope you’ll check it out, especially Episode #3 about confidence. That one would be particularly helpful to any runner. His podcast is on Apple, Spotify, and Stitcher.Click  the  graphic  to  check  it  out.

***In this episode, I also reminded you of our documentary film, The Human Race. I decided I’ll mention one of the featured runners in each of the next several episodes. In this episode of mention Riorita Gaon. Here is a pic. I hope, if you haven’t watched The Human Race, you will. I promise it will provide great motivation. Many runners have told me they bought it and watch it whenever they need motivation. That’s Rio in the pink sunglasses and with the mimosa, with friends Maureen Wallace and Nancy Hannas.

However, sometimes we make some rash discussion when it comes to shedding pounds healthfully. I will discus the reason some are not losing the weight and you may think your doing everything right. 

Thanks for listening and for more information on this topic, visit here: 
http://daynadetersfitness.com/momma-fit-podcast-episode-64-reasons-not-losing-weight/ Have you thought about your life goals? Life goals are the things that excite you, something that you would like to work on and achieve in order to be satisfied with your future and who you become. These could be anything from better relationships, a career advancement, starting a business, to traveling the world, to improving your health and finance. Some are specific, others are more open. However, without at least one such goal in mind, you won’t see much progress in the right direction.

Luckily, for you this episode is all about setting those life goals, and ways to accomplish them. I have also included the free Dream and Goals Vision Board for you to get started with. Just download it on this link: http://daynadetersfitness.com/momma-fit-podcast-episode-63-life-goals/

Make sure with this download you write down every reason why you should pursue this goal, and imagine what your life will become because of it. Would you still be the same? Will you live with regret, or relief? Do you think your relationships will be impacted as a result? How about looking ahead years from now and seeing what your life would be like since you chose not to pursue your goal. Would you feel sad, angry, how is it going to impact your lifestyle? Think long and hard about these questions and remember taking a risk, or experiencing failure is part of the journey and will be far less painful than having regrets.

iTunes: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/momma-fit-podcast/id1181724096 Although many of us may not realize it, rest days are very important when it comes to your overall health and fitness.  Our bodies are amazing and can work hard when we want to.  But it’s also very important to give our bodies rest, as well.  When we take a day off from those hard workouts it gives our bodies time to repair themselves.

HERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT REASONS THAT REST DAYS ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS WORKOUT DAYS. 

Rest days allow your muscles time to repair.

Did you know that when you’re lifting weights, you’re tearing your muscle fibers?  Giving your body proper nutrition (which includes plenty of protein) and allowing it to rest is the best way for you to build stronger muscles.  If you work the same muscles multiple days in a row, you aren’t allowing them time to repair themselves and increase in size and could be doing more harm than good.  You also may not see the results you’d like because your muscles aren’t being given enough time to heal, and your chances of injury can increase. 

Rest days help you avoid burnout.

We’re putting in the necessary effort to see results but then it happens, we get burned out.  Trust me, it happens to us all, me included back in the day. Giving your body a few days off will help you feel rejuvenated and ready to get back to work.  Also, make sure you change your workouts up when exercising. I try to change things up a bit and swap out moves or try a different style of working out.  If you feel like you’re getting burned out, try change your workouts up a bit. 

Rest days reduce the risk for injuries.

If you work a muscle too often, it has a less chance to recover.  This can lead to weak (tired) muscles and in turn potential injuries.  Along with this, if you’re over-training certain muscles, your body will utilize other muscles to provide support to your skeletal system.  You risk injuring these other areas because they are trying to provide support for those weaker areas that have been over-worked.  

Over-training can affect our sleep.

Are your sleep habits all over the place? Over-training could be the reason. Too much exercise can put your body in a constant state of restlessness or on high alert making a good night’s sleep tough to achieve. A big sign is an increase in your resting heart rate. Taking those rest days can help bring down your alertness and heart rate, which can help get you a night of sound sleep. Make sure to get a good night sleep, it will help heal and recover from those workouts. 

WHEN SHOULD YOU TAKE A REST DAY?

How often you have days off from the gym depends on where you are in your physical fitness journey.  If you’re beginning your fitness journey, a good rule of thumb is to rest every third day.  If you’re a more experienced athlete, resting once a week is usually enough.  But you should try to avoid working the same muscle group multiple days in a row.  

What constitutes a rest day also varies depending on your activity level.  If you’re doing high intensity interval training, or killing it in the gym, a full inactive rest day is more likely needed for your body to fully recover.  If you’re workouts have been on the light to moderate side, an active rest day is enough.  This could mean going for a long walk, doing some relaxing yoga or foam rolling.   
Rest days are critical for our mental and physical health.  Allowing ourselves rest can help fuel us to the next workout performance.  Don’t be afraid to take a day off, they are just as important to our health as a workout. Detox. It's one of those popular expressions you hear constantly.

A seasonal detox is an effective way to clear your body of toxins, which will also speed up your metabolism and enhance your overall health. Start by decreasing the amount of sugar you consume and keep your foods closer to natural whole foods.

When done correctly — that is to say, in a healthy, safe and controlled environment —getting your body clean and healthy can result in a wide range of positive effects.

If you are not convinced, yet. These are some reasons, detoxing can help you...

1. They help remove toxins from the body.
Whether it be the long-term exposure to toxins (environmental pollutants, cancer-causing chemicals, preservatives, pesticides, heavy metals, and industrial waste) affects our metabolism, behavior, immune system, and leads to disease. They can be stored in tissues and cells throughout the body, including the brain, often for years – holy moly! 

2. Doing a detox annually or bi-annually can prevent chronic disease.
Environmental toxins are responsible for many cancers, neurological diseases, heart disease, strokes... you name it. Our bodies do have a built-in detox function to deal with these dangers, but those systems are constantly overloaded! Detoxing assists and improves what our bodies are trying to do naturally.

3. Bonus! It can aid in your weight-loss. 
Toxins can influence the body's natural ability to burn fat, leading to weight gain. Diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure are directly linked to weight issues. Detoxing rids the body of toxins stored in fat cells and increases metabolism.

4. It can enhance the immune system function.
Goodbye to sickness! 
A compromised immune system makes us vulnerable to colds and flus, affecting our quality of life and productivity. Regular detoxing helps strengthen immune system functioning and fights off infection.

5. You can improve your quality of life.
Our bodies don't function very well when they're loaded with toxins. We may have joint pain, headaches, digestive disorders, sleep problems, and lack of energy. Depression may be eased, and memory may be improved as a result of detoxification. Of course, everyone is different of course and people’s bodies will detox differently.

6. Hello energy!
Not only will you have more mental, physical, and emotional energy after detoxing--people also say that they sleep better!

7. It can slow down premature aging.
Detoxing rids the body of free radicals and heavy metals partially responsible for aging. Detoxing helps to increase nutrient absorption, including antioxidants and vitamins that help fight oxidative stress. 

8. You will experience more mental and emotional well-being. 
When the body's systems are aligned, a shift also occurs with our mental and emotional states. We can deal with more when we're clear and grounded. We can make better decisions, have a clear mindset, and see things differently.

9. You will be glowing. 
Nutrition and environmental toxins undeniably affect skin. Detoxing improves acne, and strengthens hair and nails, and gives us a natural, healthy glow.

10. Detoxing will create more of a balance to our body's systems.
Our digestive, nervous, and hormonal systems were designed to work together to achieve optimum health. This is what our bodies want to do! When we overload them with toxins and unhealthy foods, these systems don't work as well as they should, and we get sick.

But maybe…you are getting to that point where you’re ready to act? But that action leads you to keep finding excuses to delay starting because of fear?

This could be because you’re:
Comparing yourself to other people
Telling yourself that it might not work
Not confident about what you know

Wondering if anyone will value what you have to say

I know I have – MANY times!

Every single one of these thoughts and feelings is driven by fear – your mindset around fear – and your mindset is something you can shift if you’re dedicated to understanding why you feel a certain way at any given time. But taking time to practice this, will weaken the fear and make your wants much stronger. When I talk about breaking through fear, I don’t mean that I don’t (or that you won’t) still feel those feelings: fear and a lack of confidence; but now I’m able to (and you can, too) embrace the fear that causes those feelings and breakthrough it as a result.

If you are wondering how to get through this and break free from your fear-- I will be going over many ways to embrace your fear, practice healthy ways to weaken the fears, and break free from what is holding you back in this episode. Unless you’ve been under a rock or maybe a pile of never-ending laundry for the last few years- you’ve probably heard of the term “self-care”. We all need it, but rarely do we take it. This word can mean different things for different people. For some- it’s going to get a massage. For others it’s just a few hours of alone time to read that book that’s been on your end table for the last six months or like me a full year collecting dust. If you’re an extrovert and ‘refill your tanks’ with the energy of those close to you, it can look like scheduling that much-needed coffee date with your best friend.

What do I like? I love to wake up an hour or so before my husband and two kids so I can get my workout in peacefully. It’s that simple. Starting my day off with that hour to myself is one of the best things I can do for myself, and therefore the people I care about.

I also feel my best when my body is healthy. I usually LOVE taking walks (when it's nice out) at lunch during my break to get a little exercise and some deep breathing going. If I’m in need of some extra mental clarity during the winter I will use the treadmill to get some extra steps in and get re-energized. 

Another thing I make sure to do to prioritize my own self-care? I ask for help. My hubby is great at helping when I ask, which is sometimes all I need. He also knows when I need a break (usually when I start yelling at the kids...lol). Mom life happens and we all have our moments. 

I think we should all be able to agree that self-care is not selfish… it’s necessary.

My advice? Let the guilt go. It is not serving you- it’s impairing you.

Tune out the negative voices and focus on yourself, because when you do that and you’re overflowing with self-worth and confidence- everyone wins. And that certainly doesn’t sound selfish to me."

More Plates More Dates,"Your One Stop Shop For All Things Self-Improvement Related Testosterone is not neuroprotective, estrogen is.
 A common myth circulating in the bodybuilding and TRT community is that testosterone is inherently neuroprotective and is unique from all other anabolic steroids in that regard.
 The reason why testosterone is neuroprotective is simply because it aromatizes at a rate that provides a sufficient amount of estradiol to balance out the androgenicity in the body.
 Data in rodent models using cortical cells suggests this very convincingly by showing how the aromatase inhibitor Anastrozole (Arimidex) completely eliminated the neuroprotective effects of testosterone [R].
 https://youtu.be/Gv_v0mJy6Bg
 Are Synthetic Anabolic Steroids More Dangerous Than Testosterone? There have been tons of studies published suggesting how much worse synthetic anabolic steroids are in contrast to testosterone for cardiovascular disease, neurotoxicity, and a myriad of other deleterious outcomes.
 I believe that a significant amount of this data is exaggerated based on the fact that exogenous estrogen is never co-administered in these studies.
 At the end of the day, testosterone is the safest androgen at physiologic dosages.
 However, I theorize that many synthetic anabolic steroids are not as dangerous as we are led to believe.
 My theory is that some compounds are not inherently significantly more dangerous than testosterone, rather, it is their lack of aromatization, 5-alpha reduction, or differing affinity for off-target receptors that makes them more dangerous.
 The effect on estrogen receptors and how potent of a substrate an anabolic steroid is for aromatase is the main factor that impacts how viable a hormone is for consideration in a monotherapy context.
 DHT derivatives cannot be converted by the enzyme aromatase into an estrogen like estradiol.
 Nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) and its derivatives (19-nors) each have their own individual affinity (or lack thereof) for estrogen receptors and interaction with aromatase, often resulting in subpar estrogen levels (exceptions to this exist such as Trestolone/MENT).
 Basically, I believe that some steroids may show to be significantly more cardiotoxic and neurotoxic in the data because they are always used on their own with an insufficient amount of estrogen to balance out the androgenicity in the body.
 The Importance Of Sufficient Estrogen Levels Healthy estrogen levels are needed for libido, erection quality, vasodilation, cardiovascular health, brain health, bone health and several other critical functions.
 In women the risk of cardiovascular disease spikes significantly after menopause.
 It isn't a coincidence that the majority of women who develop heart disease have it occur after their estrogen production has dropped to sub-male levels.
 If you don't have a sufficient amount of estrogen relative to androgen levels in the body, cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity levels will be significantly higher than they would be if healthy estrogen levels were sustained.
 From a bodybuilding perspective, estrogen is needed to optimize muscle growth, fat loss, as well as IGF-1 and growth factor production/cellular signaling.
 This is why heavily aromatizing steroids may indirectly result in greater growth potential and are often classified as ""bulking"" compounds.
 Anecdotally, many bodybuilders report that the most they've ever grown was during off-season mass building phases when their estrogen levels were through the roof.
 The Point Of A Testosterone Base Testosterone is not tissue selective and is actually a poor muscle builder milligram for milligram when compared to other synthetic anabolic steroids developed in the years following its discovery.
 
 When it comes to nitrogen retention, on paper it is not superior to many anabolic steroids.
 However, it aromatizes into estradiol at a very tightly regulated rate, it is bioidentical, and our body knows Kevin Levrone is among professional bodybuilders like Dorian Yates who have opened up about their steroid cycles and dosages.
In an interview with Muscular Development Kevin Levrone outlined his first and second steroid cycles with specific details, which gives us great insight into what kind of compounds and dosages he used to build his physique up.… As more and more IFBB pros and past Mr. Olympia winners like Dorian Yates start to open up over social media about their steroid use, we have started to get incredibly detailed insight into things like their genetic response to their first steroid cycle.… After reviewing the molecular weight of some of the most promising SARMs developed, I theorized that they could potentially be prepared in a topical solution for hair loss prevention.
As you probably already know, Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) are a class of androgen receptor ligands that bind to androgen receptors and exert tissue selective anabolic effects with a relative lack of androgenicity when compared to traditional anabolic steroids.… There's a misconception that Finasteride is a reliable source of remedy for hair loss prevention caused by the intake of all anabolic steroids.
For anyone who has reviewed the downstream mechanisms of Finasteride in the body, it is clear that this is not true.… It’s theorized in the bodybuilding community that the reason Flex Wheeler and other top Olympia caliber bodybuilders are able to build such incredible physiques is due to Myostatin deficiency.
Other popular theories circulate around that include ideas as vastly different as androgen receptor sensitivity is higher in top bodybuilders, to the complete opposite side of the spectrum where some believe that training past a certain pain threshold is what separates champions from the rest and that genetics are j"

MoviMente,"Dove si parla di Fitness, Sport e Movement Training. Contiene pensiero critico e attitudine punk. Bentornati!
Questo episodio è dovuto. Spiego l'evoluzione del mio rapporto con il termine e il concetto di fitness. Perché non penso più che sia il male assoluto e perché penso che non dovrebbe essere differenziato dall'educazione fisica.

Dedicato a tutti quei trainer che ho incontrato nel mondo del fitness e che resistono lavorando onestamente e con competenza, a differenza dei molti improvvisati e/o truffatori belli e buoni. Che cos'è la mindfulness, e qual è il suo ruolo nel fitness? 
Oggi sono sempre di più le pratiche fisiche, movement training incluso, che propongono benefici non solo per il corpo, ma anche per la mente. In questo episodio vediamo un'analisi che cerca di fare chiarezza e propone dei metodi da sperimentare per rendere il nostro allenamento più consapevole, cercando di far piazza pulita sia della fuffa new age sia delle becere formule commerciali. Quando si parla di doping e steroidi spesso ci si riferisce al mondo del bodybuilding. Peccato che far ciò sia come sparare sulla croce rossa e distoglie l'attenzione dalla reale portata del fenomeno, capillare in tutti gli sport agonistici e addirittura nel mondo della danza e del cinema. In questo episodio cerco di infrangere un po' di miti sul doping e di fare un po' di luce su questa pratica ipocrita del si fa ma non si dice. Una delle domande che mi viene rivolta più spesso è: come posso allenarmi e imparare il movement training da autodidatta?
In questo podcast cerco di rispondere nella maniera più esaustiva possibile, dando sia alcuni suggerimenti generali e validi per qualsiasi tipo di allenamento che si affronti da soli sia alcuni suggerimenti specifici per quanto riguarda il movement training. Allenarsi in maniera estremamente dettagliata e schematica o lasciarsi andare alle sensazioni, all'esplorazione e all'improvvisazione? Questi due mindset ""estremi"" da sempre delimitano il Movement Training, con alcuni che spingono per lavorare solo ed esclusivamente sull'uno o sull'altro. Come spesso accade, secondo me, una via più equilibrata è quella di mezzo.

Dr. Ian C. Dunican, PhD (in his own words):

I have over 20 years international professional experience in health, safety and improvement within military, mining, rail, oil and gas, and other utilities. Combining scientific research and operational leadership, I support organisations in reducing risk, lowering cost and optimising productivity and performance. I have applied Lean/Six Sigma and other scientific methodologies in significant projects to drive step-change improvement in performance, whilst ensuring sustainability through associated culture change. In the mining, oil and gas sectors, I have worked internationally as an advisor to major companies including BHP, Anglo Gold Ashanti, South 32, Karara Mining, Peabody and Goldcorp. I have been responsible for the development of global practices, integration and project management across multiple product groups. This has entailed the quantification, analysis and interpretation of multiple data streams to support health, safety, financial strength and productivity. 

Currently I am the Director of Melius Consulting/Sleep4Performance. I received a PhD from the University of Western Australia (UWA) working with elite athletes and sporting organisations to optimise performance. I am a highly sought researcher, having worked with Olympic and elite athletes at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) and West Australian Institute of Sport (WAIS), and with professional teams in Super Rugby, Basketball, Australian Rules Football (AFL) and martial arts (judo, boxing, grappling). A regular speaker/chair at universities and international conferences in mining, transport, sports performance and physiology, I regularly contribute articles to media outlets such as the Australian Financial Review, The Australian, Men’s Fitness, Blitz Martial Arts, BJJ Scout and Huffington Post. I have spoken on the Health Report on ABC radio in Australia, ABC radio national and numerous podcasts. Also I have appeared on ABC television, Channel 7, 9 and 10 in Australia, and was a TEDx Perth speaker in 2017. 

I am author and co-author of numerous technical reports, scientific articles and industry guidelines, and I am a regular reviewer for scientific peer reviewed journals. I host Sleep4Performance Radio, a podcast dedicated to education, knowledge sharing and promotion of the value of managing sleep. Through my website www.sleep4performance.com.au, I provide blogs, resources and research on all aspects of sleep, recovery and performance. An active sportsman, I have completed over 20 ultramarathons to date including the Ultra Trail Australia 100km (7 times), Leadville 100 miler, numerous marathons and trail running events. I hold a brown belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and enjoy cross training with bodyweight exercises and Kettlebells. My current focus is improving my swimming in order to undertake long distance open water swimming events.

As part of our December theme to “Move More,” we are re-releasing Part 2 of our interview with Dr. Jenny Ploss, PT who works with a range of orthopedic clients at Langford Sports &amp; Physical Therapy in Albuquerque. She graduated in 2012 from the University of New Mexico with a Doctor of Physical Therapy degree after studying biology and playing collegiate soccer at the University of California at Davis.



Jenny believes her job as a physical therapist extends beyond helping clients overcome pain and disability. She believes the ultimate goal of any fitness or healthcare professional should be to help each client find an enjoyable way to keep moving well as long as possible in order to maintain a higher quality of life, greater independence, and the ability to explore and enjoy life.

Jenny is an avid rock climber, and also loves to backpack, run, and bike. In 2016, Jenny was introduced to MovNat through a colleague, and has adopted these natural movement patterns as a way to maintain her fitness and movement skills so that she is better prepared for higher level skills and competitions. She loves using these movements with her clients, and truly believes that natural movement is a more sustainable way of keeping your body healthy and reducing risk of injury.

This episode was originally released on October 24, 2018.  Part 1 of our interview with Dr. Jenny Ploss, PT, was released on October 10, 2018; here’s the link: http://www.moving2live.com/2018/10/10/podcast-3718-jenny-ploss-physical-therapist-langford-sports-physical-therapy-movnat-part-1/

On today’s MultiSport Mojo Podcast I’m joined by Hillary Mauch. She’s a five time Ironman finisher, with a handful of half-Ironman and marathon finishes on her resume as well. Like all of us she’d love to have the perfect race day. But so far, that just hasn’t been her luck. Bone chilling cold rain, record high temps, you name it – she’s encountered it. In fact she’s starting to wonder if there’s even such a thing as the perfect day. So, what’s her approach to race day? Preparation. And a lot of it. There isn’t a detail she hasn’t thought about, a T she hasn’t crossed and a just-in-case she isn’t ready for. Listen and learn as ultra-disciplined, ultra-prepared, ultra-organized triathlete Hillary answers “13 Questions Every Multisport Athlete Wants To Hear Your Answers To.”

On today’s MultiSport Mojo Podcast I’m joined by Michael Schneider. When the avid motocross rider found out his marathon running mother had breast cancer, he and his brothers decided to go all in on supporting her – and they signed up to run their first marathon. With matching shirts that said, “We hate running and our mom hates cancer!” they crossed the finish line after 16 weeks of motivated training and beat their sub-4 hour goals. “On those long, hard training runs I’d say a little prayer for my mom hoping it could give her the push she needed to get through her keemo treatments,” he says. “I knew if she was fighting with everything SHE had, that I could fight just as hard to do the thing she loved.” Listen in on this inspiring story as first-time marathon finisher Michael answers “13 Questions Every Multisport Athlete Wants To Hear Your Answers To.”

It was an absolute privilege to have a man who achieved this amazing feat and a whole lot more on the show today. His name is Milos Sarcev, and possibly one of the most aesthetically pleasing physiques to ever walk the earth. Milos is one of Ben’s biggest mentors and certainly one of the hardest working athletes our host has ever worked with.
 Today, Milos talks about his radical devotion to building muscle, which involved obsessive journaling and massive intakes of protein offset by equally extreme workouts. Milos was able to maintain perfect condition in each one of his 77 competitions, and today he shares some of what it took to achieve that, including his unique approach to hyperemia. We also hear from Milos about how he took Hidetada Yamagishi to Mr. Olympia in spite of wide skepticism through the use of his brutal training schedules. If you couldn't keep up with Milos back then, he would simply kick you out of the gym. We also talk about our upcoming muscle camps which will combine Milos’s giant sets with Ben’s form focussed styles, a combination that will no doubt lead to mind-blowing shifts in the way you think about working out.

They talk about morning routines, mindfulness, intentionality and more!

Musing with Tonya Dee Podcast,"Tonya Dee is a Holistic Sha' Medium. Incorporating Subtle Energy Surgery and Prescribing Indigenous Technologies for Healing. She is an empath, which means she is affected by other people’s energies, and has an innate ability to intuitively feel and perceive others. She acts as an intervening body through which these energies communicate, then assists people in realizing the physical and emotional affects they have. Her abilities are used in a healing capacity to treat the whole person, taking into account mental and social factors.Your life is unconsciously influenced by others’ desires, wishes, thoughts, and moods. Tonya “sees” your body as an energetic center first and a physical body second. She explains that every “body” has its own individual, unique Energetic Body just like your thumbprint, no two are the same. She teaches that the importance of energy extends into our physical well being and correlates directly with our eating habits, environment, inner and outer world.  More and more maladies are connected to your physical eating habits, put simplistically, plants have energy or vitality—fast food has zero vitality. If you eat food with no vibration your energy body suffers while your physical body is depleted. Same with your environment. Being able to identify energy from a young age, she recognizes “energy” around not only bodies but physical elements. She sees the spark between the sky or heavens and the Earth plane, and how these interact with the energy of the body. All these Energies are co-mingling and her goal is to get them all vibrating together to create optimum vitality. Engaging some Energetic Boundaries at the Root Center. If you are having issues with Boundaries in your Base Center, all kinds of Mishaps can happen. I believe we all need to spend a little bit more time ascending and less time descending into the Subtle Realm. Although, it’s really about balance and merging both of these together.Thanks for Tuning In – Liking and Sharing the Love – Ashe’Have you Browsed the Corridor of My Musing Club?

My Darling Vegan,"Every week vegan chef and blogger Sarah McMinn takes an approachable look at veganism as we talk about how to prepare vegan food, the hidden benefits of a plant-based diet, and how to take veganism beyond the kitchen and into our everyday lives. On this episode of My Darling Vegan I sit down with  a good friend, Carolanne Fry, to discuss the life-changing benefits of a vegan diet. We cover everything from health, to the environment, and of course, animals. Carolanne speaks about her values with passion and grace is one of my favorite vegans I know. After listening to this episode, I think you'll see why. On this episode of My Darling Vegan I sit down with Katie Koteen, found of the website Well Vegan and co-author of the book Frugal Vegan. We talk about raising vegan families on a budget, running a virtual business, and how to write and publish a cookbook.

You can get Frugal Vegan and learn Katie's delicious recipe for BBQ Chickpea sliders with pineapple slaw at www.mydarlingvegan.com/frugalvegan On this episode of My Darling Vegan I uncover the secrets behind three of my favorite vegan whole food substitutions for eggs, meat, and cheese.  We explore the science behind aquafaba, get a little sticky while preparing a fresh green jackfruit, and, once and for all, put an end to the question, “what is NOOCH?! On this episode of My Darling Vegan, I sit down with Veganizer's, Waz Wu and Owner of Red Sauce Pizza, Shardell Dues. We talk about the important role that restaurants play in the vegan movement, the unsustainability of eating meat, and how vegans can make a change by asking for more plant-based options at their local restaurants. In our first, teaser episode of My Darling Vegan, I tell you a little bit about how I got here: being a full time vegan chef, blogger, and (now) podcaster. Here’s my story on all things vegan. I hope you’ll follow along. Hint: subscribe and we’ll be back in your feed in later this week."

 After working with a Holistic Veterinarian, he began educating dog &amp; cat owners on why raw food is best. He opened THEO Pet Grocery in Montclair, NJ to make these options available to pet owners by selling excellent products, in addition to sharing information on feeding a species appropriate diet &amp; how it can increase the health and longevity of our pets. His store is partly named after his dog Theo, but also yields a significant message with it’s acronym: The Healthy Evolutionary Options .
  
 Gregori also created a large facebook group called Holistic Animal Advice and Raw Feeding - THEO Pet Grocery to discuss and spread awareness of the latest in the pet food industry, alongside multiple Holistic Veterinarians.
  
 He talks about how the old ways of the pet food industry has really caused a lot of illness in our animals and it's evolved to what it is today, with the raw food movement.
  
 Erin asks the tough question of why most Veterinarians don’t advise we feed Raw Food. Thanks to Gregori, more information is being shared to educate all of us on the immense benefits of feeding fresh. The two talk about their favorite brand on the market currently, called Answers. Erin feels it’s an excellent start to switching your dog to fresh food.
  
 In addition, Gregori talks about the various ways we unknowingly introduce our pets to dangerous disease causing toxins and how there are safe alternatives we can replace those with.
  
 Provided below is a link to help you find a Holistic Vet in your area. Some integrate both Eastern &amp; Western medicinal methods to help the symptoms your pet is experiencing.
  
 Erin thanks Gregori for taking part in My Empower Project where he ENLIGHTENS us, EMPOWERS pet owners to do your own research, encourages how we must EMBRACE the need to change, &amp; EMBARK on stepping out of the norm, for own precious pets. They are family, and we are their entire world.
  
 When you visit Theo Pet Grocery either in person, or order online, be sure to tell Gregori &amp; his employees that Lilly’s mom Erin sent you, or type it in the notes when ordering J

   In this episode, Erin talks to Marian about teaching client acquisition for coaches, consultants, and content creators. It doesn’t matter what you sell as long it has some sort of conversation. Marian has a way of teaching the system and also implementing the system.
 
 He specializes in helping brand owners with high ticket offers ranging from $2,000 and up.
 Marian mentions if you are just starting out, it’s important to understand who your ideal customer is and to know exactly what your offer is.
 
 He offers tips on the importance of knowing your competitors. If you have competition, it means people are willing to pay for that type of service. We want to look at competitors because they have already proved the model, and there is no reason to test something new if there is already a working model. One specific tip Marian shared is to identify their most popular videos on their channels.
 This episode is packed full of generous valuable business building advice. Listen to Marian discuss brand awareness campaigns, how to build your sales machine, and advice for the digital teaching space.
 
 If you have a brand, you don’t want to miss this one!

   In this episode, Erin talks to Ashley Barnhart about creating the concept for her podcast. Once laid off from her job, it was the perfect time for Ashley to start the Adult Struggles Podcast.
 Ashley and her guests share their life struggles &amp; lessons learned along the way, from ordinary everyday tasks to significant life milestones. Her &amp; her friend wished they would have learned more real-life skills in school, hence Adult Struggles was born. Why isn’t there a class about filing your taxes and buying a house?
 Ashley attended Podcast Movement in Orlando, Florida, where she found community. She found it amazing to be at the event &amp; surrounded by other people who have the same interest as herself. With loads of people in attendance, you get to meet others who just started their show &amp; also people who have had their podcast for years. Ashley &amp; Erin discuss their thoughts on why entry into podcasting is so much easier than other platforms. The barriers to entry for podcasts are less expensive &amp; more straightforward.
  
 Stay tuned to hear Ashley describe the importance of branding and how to overcome adulthood.

   Jessica Brown is a Certified Business Consultant, Launch Strategist and CEO of Jessica Brown &amp; Co.
  
 For the past 15 years, Jessica has managed multi-million-dollar product launches for start-up businesses thru Fortune 500 companies. Partnering with her Business-to-Business clients, Jessica helps them to target ideal customers, test products, and prepare the marketplace for successful launches.
  
 Expanding her launch consultation to coaches, consultants, and creatives on a budget, Jessica cuts through the fear, doubt and overwhelm, that can come with launching, by breaking down the process into simple, actionable, and fun steps.
  
 Known for her personalized strategies that produce results, Jessica teaches her signature approach to launching in the Launch It Bootcamp, an online program designed to help entrepreneurs confidently launch their products and increase their profitability and impact.
  
 _____
  
 Jess begins by defining a launch.  It is a marketing campaign targeting a specific group of people, and asking them to do a specific action at a specific time. After helping large companies and entrepreneurs, Jessica created an 8 week online course which consists of a mixture of educational videos and interactive group activities, preparing her students to execute a marketing campaign style launch.
 Erin was a recent student of hers in 2018 and explained how Jessica’s coaching style also incorporates mindset strategies, which are helpful in the ups and downs of entrepreneurship. She also mentioned how the printable worksheets Jess offered deemed quite valuable in ensuring to take the necessary steps.
 Jess shared these 5 simple steps to launch mastery:
 Step 1 - create your launch plan
 Step 2 -  warm up audience
 Step 3 - activate your buyers
 Step 4 - open your sales cart
 Step 5 - celebrate, deliver, gather your data
 Jessica’s course, called Launch It Bootcamp is ideal for any coach, consultant, or creative who is looking to leverage launches to grow their new or existing business. Anyone can value from this course, whether you are a beginner or fine tuning your sales.
 Testing is the best way to begin. Jess dives deep into the 5 steps above &amp; breaks down her course into areas to focus on at different stages of the game. Her Bootcamp explains the actions to take according to if it’s your first launch, or you are many launches in with data and tweaks under your belt already.
 Considering your audience, and overcoming your own self-made boundaries are definite musts in creating a successful launch.  LaunchIt Bootcamp helps with momentum, and as Jess stated,…” let's be honest, if you start winning, don't you feel more motivated to keep going?”
  
 Her hands on approach to being there while her students take her Bootcamp is also a game changer, including workshops and &amp; multiple Q&amp;A sessions.
  
 Jessica’s encouragement is genuine and her teachings are backed by over a decade managing multi-million-dollar product launches. Stay tuned for her next course enrollment coming late Winter/early Spring 2020.

  https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/my-empower-project/id14383571 Queena Tahi hosts a podcast called Mompreneur BFF &amp; speaks about all things motherhood &amp; also social media. She loves hearing other moms, Mr. Moms, &amp; non-moms share their stories of different definitions of motherhood.  Erin has only been a dog mom, and says there shouldn’t be expectations based on age, since everyone’s journey is different.
 As Queena works from her home in Hawaii, she mentions how she went from a young mom to a business owner, &amp; encourages moms to engage with each other since more often than not, they don’t have many adult conversations while raising their children. She shares the power of networking as she found other Polynesian women whom she would not have met if she didn’t start her podcast.
 Erin &amp; Queena discuss their enjoyment of podcasting &amp; Queena suggests just starting since everyone’s first try is only practice &amp; you improve over time.
 
 Queena now helps women with social media content, with a focus on video, especially Instagram’s IGTV. Her IGTV live video guideline is available now!

About Kate
Kate is a gritty entrepreneur with experience in the management and development of teams in startups and non-profit organizations. She is a published author of Graced By Grit: The Entrepreneurial Woman’s Guide To Starting A Business With Power, Passion &amp; Purpose. Kate received her BA in Sociology and Psychology from UMass Amherst. As an entrepreneur, she owned her own company, Absolutely Organized, that organized small businesses and homes. She launched, coached, and grew a youth and masters swim program at a private health club in Plymouth, MA. Upon moving to Southern California in 2008, Kate was a youth and masters swim coach and an executive for The Boys and Girls Club in which she planned and ran events, coordinated fundraisers, ran the day to day office operations, and launched new revenue-driving community programs. In addition, she privately coached women and women's running groups. Kate and her business partner, Kimberly, were inspired to start GRACEDBYGRIT while training for a triathlon. They realized there was a lack of high-performance athletic apparel for 30-60-year-old women that made them feel safe, look great and protect them from the sun. They started GRACEDBYGRIT in 2013 and sold the company to HYLETE in 2018. Kate was hired as the VP of Brand Experience for HYLETE. She brings a female voice and narrative to the HYLETE brand focusing on expanding the women's product offering at HYLETE and elevating the emotive, relatability and relevance to the brand voice. Kate takes the first female seat at the executive table at HYLETE.
Stay in touch with Kate through HYLETE at @trainhylete on their website, hylete.com, or on LinkedIN @KateNowlan. Heidi Armstrong is here to talk to us about how she helps athletes overcome the mental fallout of a serious injury. Heidi found her way to the adaptive community after she suffered a competitive mountain biking injury. After the injury and many surgeries, she found herself angry, insufferable at times, and miserable with her new life.


Luckily Heidi found herself surrounded by people who were willing to step in when she needed it most and urge her to get help. But when she decided to get help, she didn't even know where to start. Heidi built herself a care-team that helped her find creative outlets as a way to manage her pain and anger.


Heidi's revolutionary turn-around to alternative therapy led to one of her therapists referring a fellow injured athlete to her for help, which then turned into several athletes. She then suffered another, severely debilitating injury and found herself talking to others who had also experienced these injuries. When she found she'd have to quit her job post-injury, she decided to explore other opportunities working with injured athletes.


In this episode we're talking about:


* Heidi's research into suffering and injuries
* What the research taught her about helping injured athletes
* The commonalities between injured athletes that helped her develop her research
* How our words and actions affect healing
* and so much more!

Sharon's Bio
Originally a Philadelphia native, Sharon moved to the Denver area in May 2017 with her wife, Katie, and two dogs.  She is solar-powered and loves an enthralling book almost as much as she loves musical theatre and the sound of a full orchestra tuning their instruments just before a performance.  In Denver, Sharon is the full-time Manager of Mass Participation Programs at USA Rugby's National Office, driving growth of non-contact, youth and partner-supported rugby throughout the US by focusing on removing barriers to play.  She is the Strength and Conditioning Coordinator for the USA Wheelchair Rugby Paralympic program, a Curriculum Writer and National Presenter for National Exercise Trainers Association (NETA), writing and instructing workshops in areas of strength and conditioning, group exercise and specialty fitness instructor certifications throughout the US.  Sharon is a Strength and Conditioning Educator for World Rugby and is formerly a SWAT Operator and SWAT Fitness Training Coordinator for Jefferson County, West Virginia.  She also holds her CrossFit Level 2 among other CF and fitness related certifications and still moonlights at Prospect CrossFit.  Sharon has a B.A. from Northeastern University and a Master’s Degree in Exercise Physiology from Northern Illinois University with an additional graduate certificate in Adapted Physical Education.  She has been working in various sport and fitness industry roles for 15 years and is deeply passionate in helping to grow the world of educated fitness professionals and intelligent strength and conditioning for all. Meet Ray Fernandez: Black Belt, CrossFit Seminar Staff for Adaptive and Injured Athletes, certified Level II CrossFit coach, CrossFit Kids instructor, USAW Level 1 Sports Performance Coach and Co-Owner of CrossFit 1904.
Ray attributes his current path to his work at a nursing home, where he worked his way up from a dishwasher to a line cook. But at the time, he couldn't see himself being a cook. So he stepped into a position in Maintenance, where he applied his knowledge of functional movement and living. After about 8 years, he re-evaluated where he was and decided that he wanted to pursue a career in the fitness industry as a strength and conditioning coach.
In this interview we're talking about

* How to make money doing what you love
* How Ray got his start working with the Adaptive community

Natty Talk Radio,"A show dedicated to discussing the sport of natural bodybuilding. Episodes include interviews with the biggest names in the sport, coverage of recent shows, as well as round-table discussions concerning training and nutrition. We are focused on educating athletes with information supported by both scientific research and personal experience. Bodybuilding continues to be one of the only sports in which athletes make decisions based on outdated research or purely anecdotal evidence. Our goal is to assist competitors with recommendations that have scientific merit and at the same time create a social hub for fans of the sport. Kent Bierly has been deemed ""The Winningest Natural Pro"" by Marc Lobliner of Tigerfitness.com because he's won more shows than any other natural pro. He recently founded the ANBF with the intention of making it the premier natural organization. We'll be discussing the new organization and going over the controversial topics that include:

-Allowing competitors on HRT to compete 
-What steps will be taken to make sure these athletes aren't creating an un-level playing field. IFPA pro Terri McBee joins Zakary Walizadeh and IFPA Pro Alberto Nunez on this episode of Natty Talk Radio. Terri is a figure competitor who has won the Yorton Cup Figure division  and made a name for herself as one of the best natural figure competitors alive! We'll be discussing how she got started in the sport, her most recent injury and the road to recovery, when she plans on returning to the stage, what it's like to be twin sisters with the undefeated women's bodybuilding wolrd champion Patricia Beckman, and more! IFPA pro and 3DMJ coach Alberto Nunez is a guest on the show where we will be discussing what differs when prepping a female client compared to a male. Topics we'll be touching on include their diet, routines, cardio, supplementation, specializing bodyparts, and much more! We'll also break down the differences between bikini, figure, and bodybuilding competitors..specifically the major differences among the three groups when it comes to peak week.  Tonight we chat with a legend of natural bodybuilding, Dianne Brown. In 2012 I had the honor of meeting her at the IFPA Gaspari Nutrition Pro where she took 1st place by a long shot. Shortly after she placed 2nd to Patricia Beckman at the IFPA Yorton Cup, the only women she's ever lost to. Staying natural she's not only made her mark in the IFPA, but the NPC as well. In 2007 she took 1st place at the very first Arnold Classic where she qualified for an IFBB pro card...NATURALLY!

 Click HERE to check out an interview with Dianne shortly after stepping off the stage at the 2012 IFPA Gaspari Nutrition Pro show.

   We're starting off the 2013 season interviewing Scivation sponsored athlete Tommy Jeffers. The discussion topics include his recent brush with death and recovery, future plans in the sport, what it was like working with Lyle Mcdonald, differences between Layne Norton and Doug Miller when it comes to contest prep, ""clean"" vs. ""dirty"" food, his past pro hormone use, clearing up controversy over his ""gyno"", who he thinks the best pros are, and much more!
  
 This one got a bit lengthy, but it's filled with valuable information and answers to questions a lot of people have been waiting for!

New Directions Women's Fitness,"Welcome to New Directions Women's Fitness where we help you transform your body, tone up & feel at ease in your skin for every occasion. Today Bhavya opens up to us about settling down in Australia as a first generation Indian-Australian and how exercise aided in her falling pregnant amongst a lot of uncertainty.
 
We discuss the health and emotional benefits of exercise and a health focused community of women that have been through the pregnancy journey.
 
How do you stay working together as a team in your relationship with your significant other when seeking to fall pregnant?
 
What is the importance of having strong social routes and being mentally stable when starting a family?
 
How do you navigate the different Western and Indian cultural expectations during pregnancy?
 
How have your friends who were going through pregnancy helped you along your way?
 
How has the training changed through each trimester?
 
Bhavya’s 3 ideas of advice for women who are seeking to fall pregnant?
Get your basic tests done. I.e. Thyroid and full blood test.
 
Get healthy with your food and physical activity before you fall pregnant. As if you have not been exercising and you fall pregnant you will be limited on how active you can be through the pregnancy.
 
Have an understanding between you and your partner as to how you are going to be going through this journey. For example during pregnancy you may become more emotional and your husband can easily become the punching bag during these times.
 
Bhavya's final quote “When falling pregnant remember all you need is piece of mind… And not a strong project plan!”

26 Actions to radiate confidence and take control of your body &amp; mind to fulfill your potential in 2019!
 
Acknowledge what you are doing today and if it is not working begin the process of change from the inside out. Create 2 dream boards. The dreams you have accomplished and the dreams that scare you now that you will accomplish.
 
Write on your dream boards why you want to accomplish these dreams and the reason MUST be bigger and more important than you.
 
Before you go to bed every night hand write a list of what you want to accomplish the following day.
 
Drink 2L of water everyday.
 
Start every morning reading your to do list for the day. Drinking your water and getting a quick workout in first thing. Commit to your training routine in the simplest way possible.
 
Create your statement of intention. Read daily. Out loud and with emotion.
 
Think of 3 people you admire that have what you want and that would be happy to help you in your journey.
 
Organise a get together with your friends that involves physical activity. Ie go for a walk, jog or ride with the girlfriends... Or go on a horse riding trip 😊
 
Check your workout, create a feedback loop that will let you know if you are improving and at the rate you want. This does not always have to be with scales!
 
Sign up to 3 physical events to complete in the next 12 months.
 
Go to your dresser and find the clothes that you absolutely love and wish you could wear but maybe they don’t fit you right now or you don’t feel ready for them. If there aren’t any dream clothes in your closet then take this as a sign to go out and buy one. Hang it up somewhere that you will see everyday as a reminder to the you that you are from this day forth. Your body is now in catch up to the new mind you have created. Very soon you will be fitting into that outfit with confidence! Don’t forget to add an image of your dress to the “Dreams soon to be accomplished” board.
Start a food journal for one week and write down everything you eating and what you were feeling and thinking at the time. This simple activity can be eye opening. Review it at the end of the week.
 
Write down 4-5 meals for next week and a shopping list in preparation for the weekend.
 
Complete a big food prepping sessions! Once you’ve done it, feel the thrill of accomplishment and book it in on a regular basis for the weekends.
 
Meditate for 5 minutes every day for a week. JUST TRY IT.
 
Beliefs, Excuses, Actions and Results. Write down all the beliefs that you have around food, exercise, your goals and how you feel about yourself. Next write down who came up with these beliefs. And finally, would your life be different with or without these beliefs?
 
Find a mentor.
 
Your environment creates you, find people that have what you want and want to help you achieve it too!
 
Pick your fasting time periods and stick with them for one week to see how it feels. You can do an 8/16 or a 12/12 to begin.
 
Complete a fasting day. Don’t eat anything for 16-24 hours. See how you go and what it feels like, then decide if you want to make this a part of your weekly routine.
 
Stop looking and watching things that depress you!
 
Focus PURELY on what you want. Never what you don’t. Your reticular activation system will not hear the “don’t” and will give you what you are focusing on.
 
Endurance training. Challenge yourself with an endurance workout this week. It must be a little longer than anything you’ve done in the past.
Remember to move what was a dream to the dreams accomplished board when the time is right and let the girls in the New Directions FB group know of your progress and accomplishments 😊
 
Reach out to someone getting started on their journey and give them a hand whether in your local community or online. We all need mentors and you have now become one!
 
Take thi Cathryn shares her story of how difficult it is to get in shape when you are in your 40's and are bombarded by conflicting advice.
Sit tight, stay strong and enjoy this riveting story as it is full of laughs, unexpected disasters and a happy ending! Today you will learn what it takes to turn your life around no matter the obstacles or the level of desperation you may be feeling at your lowest point. The tide will shift.
 
Karalyn has been generous in allowing us to learn from her story.
 
We are going to be guided through her journey starting from a prosperous and hard working young school girl. To the determined women battling through life as she handles the diagnosis and symptoms of endometriosis. The many surgeries that follow and the trauma of miscarriages that this brought on in her 20s and 30s.
She hit rock bottom a few months before meeting with me at New Directions and that was one of the accelerating factors that changed her world and her life’s trajectory.
 
Starting your 20’s with a diagnosis of endometriosis.
Karalyn talks about the frustrations she had with herself, her employers and friends as she managed her symptoms and work life balance. She remembers “Nobody understands what you were going through or what you had and you needed to take time off work constantly.""
Typically she was having surgery every 4 years if she was lucky.. or 1-2 years if she wasn't very lucky.
These constant breaks from work would make her question her own reality ""You feel like it is just all in your head and you’re just being a hypochondriac."" 
 
What is endometriosis? 
Endometriosis is a medical condition that occurs when the lining of the uterus, called the endometrium, grows in other places, such as the fallopian tubes, ovaries or along the pelvis. When that lining breaks down, like the regular lining in the uterus that produces the menstruation, it has nowhere to go. This causes cysts, heavy periods, severe cramps and even infertility. 
You can find more information here.
In Karalyn’s words you can be ""Riddled with lesions and not have any pain or a small lesion with excruciating pain. The only means of treating it is with surgery.""
 
 
Endometriosis leads to difficulty having children.
Karalyn explains that she did not have problems with falling pregnant but, she had a long history of multiple miscarriages. Most women have trouble falling pregnant with the growths from endometriosis.
 
Being enveloped by grief and powerlessness.
During this time the ""Why me, (I was) worn down by it all... and then you'd have the surgery and for a little while you would feel a bit normal..""
Bit by bit the sense of control, being able to fit in and making changes for the better began to feel out of reach.
 I began “Neglecting myself physically and I felt so needed elsewhere that I took a backseat to my own health and my own well-being.”
“I never gave myself the permission to look after myself. At this point the endo was getting quite bad.”   
 
Reached out to my GP and seeking a therapist. 
“I was really ashamed at that point... Especially that I needed help. It was a very dark place. Thankfully things started turning around. I found a brilliant therapist. An amazing women. It was wonderful to be able to speak to someone independently and get a bit of perspective.”
“That was the first point of progress. Maybe you should start exercising again and getting out there. Sometimes you do have to make that leap...”
  
Finding New Directions
I saw Marisa's fitness journey of losing 45kgs and read her story. 
“I didn't want to miss that potential to train with you. You hold such a safe space. I had to prioritise myself. I felt like a I had no time to get what I wanted done, done... And then some how I found 5 hours a week to be working out!”
 
“It was then that I realised I was the one holding the chains over myself.“
 
 
The Beginning of Progress! The change of tide.
After recognising that she had been very agreeable to everyone else’s needs she knew she had to start to be more assertive. She decided on the minimum that she need for herself and How Kristina dropped 16kgs in 16 weeks.
 
Today Kristina opens up about the difficulties of being a larger girl in your 20's, how she got there and what it took to turn her fortunes around.
Beginning with distance and reflection.
It all began with a holiday away in Bali for her to realize she was not in a good way back home. She was in a relationship that was bringing her mental and physical health down, eating anything she wanted and had no desire to consider the future as daily life was difficult enough.
Her holiday itself entailed her favorite forgotten past times... yoga, walking, eating clean food and being in the great outdoors.
 
Swift action.
Within weeks of her return swift action was implemented as she broke off with her partner, began walking everyday and slowly started losing weight.
 
Calling in the reinforcements.
After a couple of weeks of this new life she decided to up her game and call New Directions in to aid in her progress. She recalls our first apprehensive meeting and how she was relieved by the non-judgmental and safe environment she found herself in.
 
Step one. Training &amp; Cutting Out The Midnight Snacks.
Kristina recalls how she mustered her faith and focused in her mind that ""I HAVE to do this for my health and my future."" Her nutrition focus rose with the introduction of the 12/12 rule. This meant only eating between 8am-8pm and fasting from 8pm-8am. 
 
Step two. Stepping it up with the 5:2 diet &amp; avoiding self imposed injury!
After a couple of weeks Kristina dived into the 5:2 diet, this being 2 fasting days of 600-800 calories and 5 days of 1200 calories. By this point the weight was dropping by up to 2 kgs per week and she remembers feeling incredibly proud and nervous all at the same time. 
 
Step three. Immersing yourself.
Kristina immersed herself around other women that are successfully losing weight or have already lost their weight and are keeping their great shape for the long term in the New Directions Womens Fitness Facebook Group. 
 
Step four, Embracing the benefits as they come.
 Black and white thinking is the death of all progress. Kristina explains how she had came to terms with the focus being on improving one day at a time rather than expecting to be perfect every single day.
 
What is Kristina's advice to get started?
Start walking! It is the smallest seed you can set your foot towards that will begin a chain reaction of events.

A pioneer of plant-based nutrition, Dr Neal Barnard, of the PCRM in Washington DC, describes the value of a plant-based diet, for the climate and many medical conditions, and just how easy it actually is to start eating this way. Andy Ramage, the co-founder of the One Year No Beer movement, tells us his story of trying an alcohol-free challenge, how significant the social pressure was, and just how good he felt as he understood his relationship with alcohol more clearly.

NFJ Podcast,"The National Fitness Junto (NFJ) is a club of mutual improvement for health, wellness, fitness, nutrition, therapy, and sports business professionals. Members gather to exchange knowledge and ideas, debate issues, and support and improve all the practices and businesses that the NFJ can influence. Investigating and discussing a wide range of topics to further understanding, promote curiosity, spur creativity and improve their standards of practice has been the goal of many of their collaborations. An enthusiasm to invite other open-minded professionals to join them in this pursuit is what inspired the creation of the NFJ Podcast. A discussion on nutrition and body composition with a couple new expert members.  If simply having more muscle doesn't dramatically increase one’s metabolism, what part of gaining muscle makes it worth-while in improving body composition? How does one gain muscle without resistance training? What is the greatest falsehood in conventional nutrition and body composition science? Meeting Date: 5/26/17 - Attending Members: Jon Greenwich - The Miller Method (Dr. Todd Miller &amp; Stephanie Mull ) - Patrick Rahm - Johannah Zabal ""The motto of the NFJ.  A discussion around questions that a few members have been considering recently. How do high doses of sugar make children hyper?  Why or when should we label ANY resistance training exercise prescription as “endurance”?  Do all of us high intensity and high volume exercisers have a kind of intrinsic opioid addiction?...and several others."" Meeting Date: 4/19/17 - Attending Members: Jordan Carter - Jon Greenwich - Patrick Rahm - Johannah Zabal ""If forced to choose, would you focus on improving one’s strength or movement? How quickly and easily should we expect “good movement” to be restored once limitations are removed? How do we learn to move if we’re never taught specifically how? How do we safely progress one’s fitness when their movement CANNOT be improved?"" Meeting Date: 2/15/17 - Attending Members: Jordan Carter - Tyler Koch - Patrick Rahm - Johannah Zabal ""The stigmas, side effects, and potential upsides of steroid use are discussed. For the military, would the potential upsides out-weigh the potential down-sides? If allowed within certain realms of society, could they be contained? What would be the consequences? Is gene editing the next and potentially safer avenue to continue pushing human limits?"" Meeting Date: 1/18/17 - Attending Members: Tyler Koch - Patrick Rahm - Johannah Zabal ""The works of Vladimir Zatsiorsky &amp; Brad Schoenfeld fuel much of the discussion. What THREE occurrences at the muscle make any training method used to elicit hypertrophy effective? Drop sets, supersets, forced reps, clusters, and heavy negatives seem to be all be touched by at least one of these three. The future with occlusion training and myostatin end the discussion."" Meeting Date: 12/21/16 - Attending Members: Paul Berry - Patrick Rahm - Johannah Zabal ""Members struggle distinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. The Self-Efficacy Model, modeling, and ""being heard"" seem relevant and may influence motivation within a training environment. A member presents his incentive model for the coming football strength and conditioning season for critique by the group."" Meeting Date: 11/16/16 - Attending Members: Jordan Carter - Tyler Koch - Jon Greenwich - Patrick Rahm - Johannah Zabal"
Niedzielne Dietetyczne Pogaduchy,"Cykl rozmów o treningu, diecie i zdrowym stylu życia, które nie będą się sprowadzały tylko do zadania kilku oklepanych pytań. Poruszam niektóre tematy znacznie głębiej i z innej strony, aby pomóc każdemu na diecie. Wiele osób podejmuje postanowienia noworoczne, aby uzyskać zdrowy zakres wagi. Wszyscy zastanawiający się nad dietami, muszą uważać na „oferty”, takie jak „zrzuć 10 kilogramów w ciągu jednego miesiąca bez diety” lub „używaj tego urządzenia fitness tylko przez pięć minut dziennie, aby uzyskać mięśnie i stracić tłuszcz"". Szanuj swój portfel i nie padaj ofiarą fałszywych planów reklamowych, fałszywych działań marketingowych i rekomendacji celebrytów. 

Od czasu założenia w 1906 r. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pracuje nad tym, by zapewnić nam wszystkim bezpieczeństwo, szczególnie jeśli chodzi o powstrzymanie produkcji i sprzedaży oszukańczych produktów odchudzających i dietetycznych. Jednakże to za mało, dlatego ja ze swojej strony, w dzisiejszym podcast'cie opowiem Ci o sześciu rzeczach, na które należy zwrócić uwagę, gdy zobaczysz kolejny super sposób, który rzekomo pomoże osiągnąć Ci Twój wymarzony cel. 

Posłuchaj! Każdy drobny krok w kierunku zdrowszego stylu życia ma znaczenie. Często myślimy, że musimy spędzać godzinę na siłowni lub trzymać dietę pełną sałaty, kurczaka i ryżu. A kiedy nie możemy osiągnąć tego poziomu, po prostu się poddajemy i nawet nie próbujemy więcej.

Nie oznacza to jednak, że musisz zadowolić się niską mentalną wygodą lub ciągłym narzekaniem na swoją sylwetkę! Nadal MOŻESZ wygrać bitwę o zdrowe odżywianie i osiągnąć swoje cele sylwetkowe, potrzebujesz odpowiedniego sposobu myślenia, odrobiny determinacji i kreatywnego startu... i o tym opowiem Ci w dzisiejszym podcaście.

https://www.facebook.com/groups/niejemsniadania/ Podczas, gdy lato to świetny czas na odpoczynek, spędzanie czasu z przyjaciółmi, rodziną, na podróżowanie i po prostu czerpanie radości z życia, to często spędzamy ten letni okres nadmiernie nie skupiając się nad właściwym jedzeniem i piciem. Jest to całkowicie zrozumiałe i całkowicie normalne. Każdy z nas tego przecież kiedyś doświadczył. 

Myślisz sobie, czas wrócić na właściwe tory! Ale jak to zrobić, gdy po powrocie do domu fizycznie czujesz się totalnie ospała, wzdęta, o niskim poziomie energii? To nie jest przecież takie łatwe. A do tego istnieje ryzyko, że jeśli nie wymyślisz szybko, jak pokonać ten stan w rozsądnym czasie, to możesz równie dobrze pozostać w tej frustrującej sytuacji do końca roku.
Dlatego dzisiaj porozmawiamy o tym, co zrobić, kiedy wrócisz do domu, co pomoże Ci szybciej skalibrować ciało i wrócić do swojej rutyny. A zastosowanie tylko tych siedmiu wskazówek, pomoże Ci szybko wrócić na dietę, po wakacyjnej przerwie.

Ile wody trzeba pić każdego dnia?

Czy śledzenie posiłków, to najskuteczniejszy program do kontroli wagi?
https://trenujzglowa.pl/czy-sledzenie-posilkow-to-najskuteczniejszy-program-do-kontroli-wagi/ To nie Twoja wyobraźnia, że ciało pęcznieje podczas upałów - to prawda. I czujesz się trochę zaniepokojona, bo dzieje się to wtedy, kiedy masz zamiar się rozebrać na plaży! 

Czy zastanawiałaś się, w jakim stopniu na masę ciała wpływa temperatura i wilgotność powietrza? Czy oszczędzamy lub uwalniamy wodę w miarę zmian klimatu?

Jeśli Twoja dieta się nie zmieniła, ale Twoje ubrania nagle stają się coraz ciaśniejsze, to ten podcast jest dla Ciebie! Ludzie, którzy mają kilka (lub więcej) dodatkowych kilogramów do stracenia, sięgają po wypróbowane i prawdziwe metody odchudzania, czyli dietę i ćwiczenia. Zaczynają biegać lub dźwigać ciężary kilka dni w tygodniu. Zaczynają zaostrzać dietę, pomijając śmieciowe jedzenie i częściej gotując w domu. No i to jest super!

Jednakże, dla niektórych osób wyniki tego procesu nie są osiągane wystarczająco szybko. Co zatem robi większość jeśli nie może osiągnąć swoich celów, na wczoraj? 

Sięga po głodowe diety lub inne ekstremalne dietetyczne ""wynalazki"", które ograniczają kalorie znacznie poniżej ich dziennych potrzeb energetycznych.

Owszem, zrzucą szybko parę kilogramów, ale co tak naprawdę dzieje się z ich ciałami? Czy w pogoni za upragnioną wagą kiedykolwiek zastanowili się, jakie są tego krótko- i długoterminowe skutki?

Dlatego Ty dzisiaj dowiesz się, co nieco na ten temat, słuchając dzisiejszego podcastu! Poznaj 5 negatywnych skutków diety głodowej oraz moje stanowisko w tym temacie. Zanim zaczniesz się denerwować, że Tobie odchudzanie zajmuje tyle czasu,  to wiedz, że istnieją czynniki, które mogą odgrywać znaczącą rolę w tym, jak szybko zrzucasz swój nadprogramowy tłuszcz."
Niel and Robbies Ultra Cycling Podcast,"Niel and Robbie are seasoned ultra cycling racers and good friends. In this podcast they bring you there take on the crazy world of self-supported ultra racing. Each show will look at the latest news from around the world, stories from their own race experiences, guidance on equipment and training, interviews with some of the worlds best racers and much more. In this episode we talk to BikingMan Taiwan female winner Julie Melville. She gives us an in depth view of what it’s like racing your bike through the jungles and mountains of Taiwan. We cover saddle sore, broken mechs, crying, love hotels, numbing cream, silk underwear and lube. But most of all Julie shows us what an awesome racer she is as she tells her story.







We hope you enjoy listening to this as much as we did recording it.







To find out more about BikingMan Taiwan and the whole series of BikingMan races check out http://www.bikingman.com In this show….







Robbie finally gets with the programme, and gets a turbo trainer. The final races of the season finish with incredible racing in both Taiwan and Italy. Niel announces his involvement as ambassador for Race Around Rwanda whilst discussing world peace. Both of them talk about their race plans for the current season where Niel is trying to convince Mrs C to do the Japanese Odyssey.  Finally they cover off bits of kit that delight them.

Race Around Rwanda In this episode, Niel and Robbie talk about one of their favourite things, eating. What they eat, how often they eat, what’s their favourite Haribo.







Also they talk Tour Divide, GBDURO, Trans Alba and the North Cape Tarifa race







Plus, Niel gets stuff wrong. A joule is a force of 1N applied over a distance of 1M. He was actually explaining the definition of a kilocalorie (energy to raise 1l of water 1c). Still both definitions of energy though. And it’s efficiency and maximal oxygen uptake that indicate potential performance, although it is believed that there is an inverse relationship between VO2max and efficency (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12471319)

Mythen über Mythen stapeln sich, es kommen immer neue Diäten heraus und jeder schwört, er habe das Geheimnis zum Erfolg gefunden (weil es ja bei ihm ja funktioniert hätte..)
Schwierig - Dabei muss Fitness gar nicht so schwer sein und auch nicht die damit vermeintliche Wahrheitssuche nach dem heiligen Gral.
Unfassbar wichtig ist es hier, den Unterschied zwischen Kausalität und Korrelation vollstens zu verstehen und auch zu erkennen, wie sich all das im Alltag äußert.
Aus diesem Grund widmen wir uns in der neusten Podcast-Episode voll und ganz dieser sehr spannenden Thematik.

No Finish Line,"Welcome to No Finish Line Podcast. In Conversation with those that go the extra mile. Featuring athlete interviews and discussion on running, training, travelling and adventure. My objective is to interview athletes from a wide range of sports and to talk about how they do what they do. We will discuss the mindset and find the point at which all disciplines intersect. Twitter @johnoregan777Instagram @johnoregan777#running #ultrarunning #marathon Aoife Mundow has gone from strength to strength since first trying an Ultra Trail Race back in late 2018.   Realising that she enjoyed the longer distance and was a natural in the hills she started to take her running a bit more seriously and in 2019 she won six of the ten races that she entered, varying in distance from 50K to 200K.  These wins included a course record in the 127km Wicklow Way Race, winning the Connemara 100 Mile, winning the Ecotrail Wicklow and also winning the 200Km Kerry Way Ultra as featured in previous podcasts.  

Most recently Aoife has set a new Women's Irish Record for 24 hrs by covering a distance of 231.376Km in the Athens International Ultramarathon festival, Jan 2019.

The previous record of 229.346Km was set by Ruthann Sheahan during the 2012 World Championships in Katowice, Poland.

In this podcast we trace back to Aoife's first race, the Great Ireland Run, a 10K that she finished in 1hr 6mins and we discuss the mindset and belief that has helped her become a world class athlete.

Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/johnoregan777/message My guest today is Richard Donovan, who will discuss the background of extreme events he organises such as the North Pole Marathon, Antarctic Ice Marathon and World Marathon Challenge. However, given his diversity, Richard is worthy of an entirely separate podcast to share some of his thoughts on the philosophy of ultrarunning, the direction of the sport and his previous roles as a Director of the International Association of Ultrarunners and Head of UltraRunning Ireland. He has organised the IAU Trail World Championships at ultrarunning, obtaining the first global TV audience in the process, and was also a Race Director of the first Commonwealth Championships at both 100km and trail ultra running. He additionally helped to launch the first Wings for Life World Run and was Race Director of the inaugural Irish event. As if that’s not enough, Richard has run across three continents and won several events such as the Himalayan 100 mile Stage Race and Inca Trail Marathon. Richard has shown himself to be a strong advocate for access to sport for people with disability and a big supporter of Irish athletes attempting to qualify for the Olympics, among others. His brother Paul was a two-time Olympian, multiple NCAA track champion and indoor world medalist at 3000m.

Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/johnoregan777/message In this episode I catch up with Irish International Ultra Trail Runner &amp; North Face athlete, Paddy O'Leary.  Paddy was home for the screening of his movie Ag Teacht Abhaile / Coming Home which focuses on the Irish Trail Running Community.  The movie uses his successful attempt at a Fastest Known Time #fkt for the Wicklow Round as a backdrop to the story. We talk about Paddy's transition from a competitive Lacrosse player to Ultra Trail Runner and how he only really discovered his true passion for the Irish trails while living in San Francisco. The Wicklow Round is a long-distance hill running  challenge in the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland.  The route follows a proscribed 100-kilometre circuit of 26 mountains, which must be completed in a fixed order, that total over 6,000 metres (20,000 ft) of elevation; there is some flexibility on route-choices between peaks.  Rounds completed outside of a cut-off time of 24-hours are not generally recorded.  Irish ultra-runners Joe Lalor and Brian Bell are credited with the creation of the Round. www.imra.ie You can follow Paddy on Instagram @poleary87

Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/johnoregan777/message Eoin Keith was the winner of the 2019 Oman by UTMB 170Km race.  In this podcast he tells us all about his race and includes some tips and strategies for anyone thinking of taking part in future events. 
The JBS is an incredibly tough and technical challenge only recommended for extremely experienced adventurers. Participants must be confident in their ability to cover very challenging terrain whilst being completely self-sufficient for a minimum of 10 hours as there are significant distances between the Aid Stations on the Jebel Shams section of the route.
Athletes taking on this epic challenge will follow the 130KM route up Jebel Al Akhdar, including the vertical climb out of Balad Sayt, before carrying on along the top of the plateau and following the trail around Jebel Shams, where they will climb to an altitude of almost 3,000m.
Runners arriving at the Aid Station at Col Trail Split within the barrier time, the point at which the Jebel Shams section starts, will be evaluated before being allowed to continue with the JBS. Those runners found not to be in a condition to take on the additional section will be re-directed onto the JBA route and will be reclassified into the JBA race.

The Kerry Way traverses one of Ireland's most spectacular mountain ranges with magnificent coastal views, lakes, moorlands and lonely glens with a mixture of tarred roads, lanes, bogs and mountain passes underfoot. It is approximately 200km of roads, lanes, trails, paths and hills, running parallel to The famous Ring of Kerry road on the Iveragh Peninsula and is a route through the Old Red Sandstone mountains of Kerry. The Way touches Irish history (old butter roads, famine graves, abandoned villages), archaeology (hilltop burial chambers, standing stones, ogham writing) and folklore (tales of the Fianna warriors and their escapades).
Starting and ending in Killarney town, with a maximum race time of 40 hours, this event is open to runners who have completed at least two marathons since in the previous year, one 50 mile event or one 100k event. It is a single stage, self-sufficient ultramarathon, with limited access for race support crews.  The entry criteria is subject to change.  For further information you can visit http://www.kerrywayultra.com/

No-Bullsh!t Vegan,"Myth-busting and evidence-based advice to help you kick butt with your health and fitness - on a vegan diet. Join our movement of No-Bullsh!t Vegans who value critical thinking and want to further our cause using scientific truths, not made-up facts. Meet our expert guests who use science to acquire knowledge about the world and how it works. Learn why some of the biggest trends in vegan health and fitness are completely false and based on misinformation.Your host, vegan fitness coach and author Karina Inkster, sifts through the bullsh!t, so you can focus on levelling-up your health and fitness in ways that actually work. Ren is a certified personal trainer, corrective exercise specialist, and nutrition coach. In this episode: How the fitness industry is changing, to the benefit of both clients and coaches. Busting some major B.S. in the fitness and diet industries. How Ren approaches habit change with his clients. The one concept you should delete from your vocabulary to ensure you get lasting results from your fitness and nutrition habits. (Hint: you can choose *fast*, or you can choose *permanent*.) If you’re starting a new fitness, nutrition, or health habit in 2020 (or if you want to make sure you keep going with your current ones), this episode is for you. I’m busting some B.S. about motivation and sticking to long-term habits. I discuss: why relying on motivation to keep up with your good habits is setting yourself up for failure, 2 things you should know when you're starting a new health habit, 2 challenges I see people face, and how to ensure your good habits will keep going over the long ter Social scientist Dr. Bo Bennett shares his ideas on the morality of eating meat. We discuss the moral framework of sentiocentrism, and using it to determine which - and how many - animal products to consume. Also: how do we make moral evaluations to conclude if killing animals for food is moral or not? And why Dr. Bennett believes encouraging reducing meat consumption is more effective than promoting strict veganism. I’m answering random questions today from awesome podcast listeners, including: how to get 100 grams of protein a day as a vegan, how the heck I fit so much batch-cooked food into my fridge (and exactly what I prep each week), the most effective strength training muscle group split, nailing the calcium RDA, getting started in the industry as a new trainer, and more. The Plant-Based Dietitian is here to discuss ""macroconfusion"": why focusing on macronutrients is not the best way to optimize your diet, and what to do instead. Also in this episode: Dietary restriction without malnutrition. Focusing on very high protein intakes (e.g. for strength training) may be at odds with research that shows longevity and healthspan are associated with lower protein intakes. How to follow a healthy, well-rounded healthspan diet. I give you my own take on vegan travel, and share insight from 13 other vegans! If you’re thinking about going vegan, if you’re vegan already, or if you’d like to be able to help others to go vegan, this episode is jam-packed with lots of information about travelling the world on a completely plant-based diet. ""Travelling is too difficult!"" is one of the main reasons I hear people cite for not going fully vegan. In this episode, I'll share why I think that's bullsh!t, and what to do about it."

Not Another Fitness Podcast: For Fitness Geeks Only,"Dr. Mike T Nelson gets geeky with the latest research and scientific findings in the fitness world. Visit www.flexdiet.com to get Flex Diet Certified and www.miketnelson.com for more geeky goodness. This week we've been talking about micronutrients that you may potentially be too high in or at least things to watch out for, especially if you are a trainer or coach. We covered Vitamin A to iron to iodine. And today we are talking about something that is essential but is provided to the body by nutrition in very very small amounts... selenium.

Visit edu.flexdiet.com to learn more about the Flex Diet Certification. This week we're talking about some micronutrients that you want to potentially watch out for. They can be more toxic or at least carry with them an increased risk if you're going crazy on them. And the one that comes up today has to do with the thyroid. So, anytime you mention thyroid, a lot of people are utterly convinced that they have a thyroid problem because they can't lose weight. 

Now, that's probably not true, although definitely can happen. The thyroid is related to that. What I've seen in general, excluding any type of pathologies, is that the thyroid is often just responding to what you're doing. So, if you're dramatically slashing your calories overnight, it would make sense that your thyroid function would go down, right? And so we're not going to do a whole in-depth talk about the thyroid, which maybe you're happy about or maybe you're disappointed. 

So, let me know your thoughts on that. We can talk more about that in the future. But today's topic is a micronutrient related to the thyroid... iodine. On today's show, we were talking about iron as a supplement, and specifically how it can offer negative returns for men. Now, I alluded to this last week but it's rare to see iron being too high in women. I think I've only seen that once. So it's pretty rare, but in theory, it could happen. In males, I've seen the opposite especially if they're consuming a lot of red meat. Listen in to hear why supplementing with iron may not be a good option for you or your clients. 

Visit edu.flexdiet.com for more info about the Flex Diet Certification. This week, we're talking about micronutrients you want to watch out for. I'm not a herbologist, I'm just looking at what we have for published research related to micronutrients that you may be getting too much of in specific circumstances. 

The item for today is actually Vitamin A - and before you all freak out, I'm not telling you to never eat carrots. We are talking about a very specific form of Vitamin A here, specifically, something called a retinal form of Vitamin A. Enjoy! This week, we're talking about micronutrients that you may want to re-consider, not necessarily avoid, but to keep an eye on. There are micronutrients that could potentially be toxic. Now I know the word toxic gets thrown around a lot and it gets really messy fast - and that's what we'll review on today's show. Enjoy! Visit edu.flexdiet.com/enroll for more info."

"Nutrição, exercício e saúde","Informações técnicas e científicas sobre nutrição, dietas, suplementos, voltados para profissionais da saúde e demais interessados Existe bastante discussão sobre a melhor dieta para perder peso. A literatura está cheia de comparações entre as principais dietas da moda, entretanto, poucos estudos avaliam seus efeitos a longo prazo (mais que 6 meses) e abordam isso em um grande número de pessoas. Assim, essa metanálise de 2015 é bastante interessante. Assista o vídeo e saiba mais.

NW Faith &amp; Fitness Podcast,"Hosted by Amelia WardenOn this podcast we'll dive into various topics within the realms of fitness and faith: CrossFit, nutrition, community, Jesus and more. Along the way I'll have interesting conversations with admirable people who can share a bit of their stories with us, and give us new insight on a particular topic. I believe that if you find yourself listening to this podcast on a regular basis, it’s because you are someone who is fascinated by, or wants to learn more about fitness and faith. You’re someone who wants to spend their time investing in their own growth as a coach, athlete, mom, parent, wife, husband, friend or just a human-being. On this episode I had the privilege of having an important conversation about mental health with Sinclair Ceasar. He shares vulnerably about his recent manic episode and how he has become resilient in the face of bipolar disorder. Get ready because this episode is packed with nuggets of hope! We also get into some tools to help anyone struggling with mental health or wanting to help a loved one who's wrestling with a mental health issue. Lyman Hiter was my first CrossFit coach and I had a blast catching up with him and talking about some helpful tools to help you make the most of your time in the gym. Lyman is the owner of CrossFit Immense in Happy Valley and has wealth of experience and knowledge in the fitness space. Can't wait for you to hear this episode! I got to sit down and chat with a member of our gym who also happened to go to the CrossFit Games as a masters athlete. Mike White is a friendly, genuine, and generous person and I love hearing his perspective on everything from athletics to faith. I had the chance to sit down with Kerstin while she was in Oregon, after leaving her mission field in South Africa, and right before she headed to Germany. I loved hearing about her time in South Africa, and also in this episode she shares so beautifully and vulnerably about her struggles with mental health. On this episode I had the pleasure of talking with Cody and Kayla Anderson! Cody is best-known for his athletic career as a CrossFit Games athlete. The Anderson's are newlyweds now and I had a blast chatting with them about marriage, CrossFit, and how to trust and follow God. On this episode, I chat with Chris McDonald who owns CrossFit X Factor in Portland, Oregon and works for CrossFit HQ, teaching seminars around the world. We talk about what is important in creating a fitness program and what is effective for older athletes. We also dive into nutrition and where you can start on a journey towards better nutrition. "
NZ BOSS Hour of Power Podcast,"Hosted by Shane “Shano” Hunter (aka NZ BOSS); is a veteran of the Fitness Industry, and not only known in the world of bodybuilding through his achievements but also a successful corporate figure is well-known in New Zealand and Internationally. As the head of Nutrition Systems NZ, he is a role model to many and a social media sensation in NZ, sharing his training secrets, motivational posts and an insight on how highly driven people can fit so much into a single 24 hour day. After a few weeks (months) away, the guys are back to catch up and discuss where they have been, what they have done and what’s to come. ""We'"" mainly being Shano talking about his arsenal of new medals from 2 IFBB bodybuilding shows and a new pro-card and what it took to get there. There is also a new APP to help others improve their eating and fitness goals ! We are BACK and back in a big WAY ! this episode is proudly brought to you by www.grisbystore.com In this episode we find out that Miss Bikini Angelica Teixeira is actually a “Misses” and if being an all-round nice person had a title, she would be the “Miss” of that too ! Angelica is living proof that starting from the bottom and overcoming obstacles without giving up, truley pays off. She had to overcome language barriers, competition rules that slowed her progress and a marathon of competitions all over the USA to earn the right to turn professional, but once she did there was no turning back or slowing down !  Today Angelica is the queen of the bikini category preparing to defend her title but remains as humble as she was during the tough times. That is why Angelica is a true ambassador of the sport and a role model to all women and men too!
 
This episode is brought to you by @gatsupplements Aaron Smith is a professional Rugby player for the Highlanders and the New Zealand national team, the All Blacks. In this episode Aaron discusses his childhood in Fielding NZ; deciding whether to play cricket or Rugby, hair-do’s and don’ts and passing on offers to switch codes in pursuit of a dream. These days Aaron is settled in his position and riding high on a wave of success but forever reflecting on the journey without forgetting where it all started. Aaron shares his ambitions for the future and describes the magic that makes playing for one of the GOAT national teams that only a select few will ever experience !

This episode is brought to you by @musclepharm In Part 2, Phil Heath brushes on being presented the Mr O title by The Rock, what went down behind the scenes during the recording of Generation Iron and some current and future projects in the works…and more ! Around the birthtime of social media, the reign of Phil Heath began and played out under the watchful eye of the cyber theatre of millions of followers worldwide! Something that no other current Mr Olympia experienced for 7 consecutive seasons in a period when anyone from anywhere in the world has a voice to use without rules; a lot of them unaware of their impact . 
One sure thing is Phil’s achievements, equalling the great Arnold Schwarzenegger with 7 Mr Olympia wins and about to enter “legacy status” walking the path where only two other men have ever been before and that’s a 8th title.

Phil doesn’t hide his goals towards success but doesn’t always disclose the good, success has enabled him to do!

Hear part 1 of the conversation with Phil and get to know the hidden path of champions! 

This episode is proudly brought to you by @gifted_athletics, @phil_app and @thegiftboxbyphil In this episode NZ BOSS discusses the highs and lows of turning 40, and as usual DJ Big Wig offers very little useful information to assist in joining the 40 club! The guys touch on the year ahead, updates on previous guests and will NZ BOSS be going through a mid-life crisis and compete again or hang up the posing leopard skin trunks? 

SPECIAL EXTRA: We go back in time and hear who NZ BOSS is, where he came from and how he ended up being the NZ BOSS compliments of a previous interview on the Chris Em’s podcast “School of Struggle”."

Off The Couch,"A program about the wide, weird, and wonderful world of running on the BLISTER Podcast Network. Duncan Callahan is one of our favorite people, so we’re excited to have him back on the show to catch up. We had Duncan on last July (Episode 9 of Off the Couch) and it was a very compelling and very honest conversation about some huge successes of his, but also about some of Duncan’s struggles and doubts and questions.
In this conversation, Duncan and I talked about the increasing amount of coaching he’s doing with Carmichael Training Systems (including coaching our own Maddie Hart); thoughts on winter training; his working through the logistics of being a coach versus being an athlete, and more.
TOPICS &amp; TIMES:
Duncan’s work with CTS (3:57)Best practices for winter training (5:25)Coaching Maddie Hart (7:47)Are there more injuries in the winter? (12:43)Staying motivated (13:51)Balancing coaching &amp; training (18:18)What big race interests you the most? (29:00) Trail Sisters is a trail running community for women and an online journal that offer lots of great resources — including articles and stories, grants, retreats, directories for female coaches, trail locations, and races that meet the trail sisters standards for gender equity. 
So Brendan Leonard and Maddie Hart spoke with Gina Lucrezi, the founder of Trail Sisters, about the unusual way in which Gina got into running; her impressive accomplishments as a runner; the remarkable things happening at Trail Sisters; the ways you can get involved with and support Trail Sisters; and Gina shares an exciting development for a brand new Trail Sisters project.
TOPICS &amp; TIMES:
Started running b/c of a bet with her mom (1:45)Competing in running (6:10)The story behind Trail Sisters (24:35)Thoughts on 50/50 male-female lottery (33:00)Joining the Hardrock 100 Board of Directors (35:35)Standards for “Trail Sister Approved” races (39:01)Trail Sisters local groups (47:00)How to get involved (50:25)Trail Sisters’ very first race (55:10)Upcoming women’s retreat (59:20) In 2019, Grayson Murphy won the US Mountain Running Championship; the World Mountain Running Championship; and the Xterra Trail Run World Championship. But there were many twists and turns along the way in getting there, and first and foremost, Grayson’s story is really about her constant push to evolve. Grayson is 24 years old and has already racked up some seriously impressive results. But perhaps even more impressive and instructive is her willingness to experiment, adjust, and explore new ideas and practices, and we discuss all of this and more in this conversation.
TOPICS &amp; TIMES:
From soccer to xc &amp; steeplechase (1:34)Signing with NAZ Elite (18:09)Getting into trail running (25:36)Trail running vs. road running culture (29:52)Navigating generalized anxiety (38:19)Working with coach Kameron Ulmer (42:29)Winning the World Mountain Running Championship (47:15)Grayson’s Planners (52:41)Interests outside of running (54:53)Experiments with diet &amp; food (55:57)Goals for 2020 (1:03:46) Sanjay Rawal was our first guest on Off The Couch, and we are pleased to have him back on for our first episode of 2020. We invited him back to ask about his rather spectacular performance — and even more spectacular meltdown — near the end of the California International Marathon this past year. But in addition to getting a fantastic first hand account of that race, we touch on a number of important topics that go way beyond some race report.
Sanjay talks about the concepts of running dumb; training slow; finding joy through exertion; and whether it is possible to run a great time by not caring about running a great time. We also talk about the urban roots of ultrarunning, Sanjay’s latest film project, the future of podcasts, and more. I assure you, there is an abundance of food for thought packed into this episode.
TOPICS &amp; TIMES:
The future of podcasts? (2:00)Lessons from 3100: Run &amp; Become (9:20)The urban roots of ultrarunning (14:06)Beyond Bonking: Sanjay’s experience at CIM (17:05)Running Dumb (32:29)Boston Marathon this April? (37:32)Training Slow (38:45)Sanjay’s take on personal resolutions (50:55)Inspiration vs. Aspiration (54:45)Finding Joy through Exertion (57:10)Sanjay’s next film: Patti Dillon (59:40) What’s the best way to eat to feel good and perform well? The fields of nutrition and diet are massive topics, as are all of the related issues surrounding them. So on our latest Off The Couch podcast, we talk with Registered Dietitian Nutritionist, Kylee Van Horn, about the various diets out there; whether certain diets are prone to help or hurt training recovery; athletes &amp; eating disorders, and more.
TOPICS &amp; TIMES:
Kylee’s running background (2:35)Her background in nutrition (19:40)Low-carb, High-fat diets (24:27)How does sleep affect appetite? (33:30)Fatigue &amp; food (35:46)Supplements (39:37)Athletes &amp; eating disorders (48:27)Adapting to seasonal changes (57:25) New races and running events seem to be popping up all the time, which raises the question: Are there some specific characteristics, policies, and practices that should be built into pretty much every running event?
To start thinking about this question, we talked to Caleb Efta, the race director of the High Lonesome 100. Caleb started the High Lonesome 100 in 2017, and the race is already a Hard Rock 100 qualifier.
Caleb has thought hard about how best to structure races, so I talked with him about how and why he started High Lonesome, and we get into some of the specific policies and requirements of the event that are designed to mitigate its environmental impacts and increase gender equality. It’s good stuff for all of us to be thinking about how and in what areas we can improve.
TOPICS &amp; TIMES:
Caleb’s background (2:18)Why the name “High Lonesome”? (26:32)Overview of the race (32:15)Conservation efforts (37:00)Progressive gender policies (43:44)Becoming a Hard Rock 100 qualifier (1:00:55)Future goals for the race (1:03:40)"
Off the Platform,"Off the Platform shares and deconstructs our personal insights and experiences in the sport of Weightlifting. We dive into the hard lessons and mistakes but also the inspiration and beauty of the process. @kim.eliotfung @coachblanco Morgan Vozobule joins us for competition and conversation. We dive deep about the monotonous grind towards success in Weightlifting, working against five years of habit change, accidentally achieving her dreams and accepting that your truest guide is yourself. We talk to director Adam Scheiner about his 2013 film vignette, ""The Artist &amp; The Olympian"" (featuring Donny Shankle) and his latest feature film project, ""The Weight"". Adam dives into his inspirations for the film and we discuss the story arc, PEDs, the drama of Weightlifting and confronting masculinity. We sit down for an honest and vulnerable conversation about the mental investment and emotional boundaries of being a coach. Framed through American Open Series 3, we discuss the performance of individual athletes while covering the challenges of coaching and leadership. We talk to our very own 2018 &amp; 2019 IWF Masters 73kg Silver Medalist— Spencer Tsai. We deconstruct his recent Worlds performance, how he won without motivation, developing trust in the coach/athlete relationship and the maintenance of excellence. Kim talks to Thea Lund— 2019 Canadian Nationals 59kg Silver Medalist. 

Thea discusses her lessons from dance, setting realistic expectations in the sport, her back injury and what it took for her to level up to the podium. Our intro and our recent wrestles with vulnerability."

Coming next week is Episode #33 which features an interview with Philippe Til about his role and backstory in translating Georges Hébert’s Natural Method books, natural movement practices, and the origins of Parkour. However this will need to wait for next week as I wanted to take some extra time in preparing this episode and the regular features around it too. I’m helping to open a gym today and the preparations and new website for it took more time than I had allotted to it these past two weeks.

Question of the Week!
How do I add Get-Ups to my workouts?
This past weekend I led a four hour intensive and I mean INTENSIVE seminar on the kettlebell get-up and one of the many ideas we discussed was how to add get-ups to our workouts and programming. I’ll add some of the ideas here, but if you would like a copy of the PDF handout from the workshop, please email info@giryagirl.com
In the mean time, here’s how I like to add get-ups to my workouts and for my clients:

Timed Practice
a. 3 minutes, 5 minutes “practice” time alternating get-ups with light kettlebell or no weight for workout warmup
b. Making a light w eight HEAVY – one side with kettlebell going for 2-5 minutes goal without putting it down.
c. Fast Full-Body Workout: 10 Minutes practice time get-ups with moderate kettlebell (or in hotel, a dumbbell!)
Working Parts of the Get-Up as individual exercises for reps
a. “Get-Up Sit-Up” = start from ground, roll to elbow, push to tall sit
b. Half Kneeling Windmill/hinge from the ground to upright and back to ground
c. Lunges with Kettlebell Overhead
Adding Presses or Small Mobility Moves to upright moments
a. Add short sets (1-5) of presses – floor press, tall sit, kneeling windmill, while standing.
b. Perform get-up, but pause and make sure you can turn your head at safe intervals.
Short set of light get-up (1/1, 2/2) at the beginning of a warm-up circuit

Fresh on the calendar at NCSystema.com! I’m leading an intensive and focused seminar on the kettlebell get-up here in Durham North Carolina on August the 10th! Taught by Adrienne Harvey… ME… RKC Team Leader, Senior PCC Instructor, CK-FMS
Spend a full afternoon focused on this incredible exercise. Beginners will learn great habits from the start. Intermediate and advanced kettlebell enthusiasts will dial in their form making every rep that much more effective.  Nearly every sport and human activity can be improved when we practice properly performed get-ups — with and without weight! This coordination, core, strength, shoulder stability, flexibility, and mobility powerhouse is useful for nearly everyone… but there’s a fairly steep learning curve. If you’ve tried to learn this powerful but oddly complex move from a book, video, or even in a group class and still feel lost, then this workshop is absolutely for you. Even “the experts” on social media are regularly sharing sub-par get-ups… and leaking strength!
I’ll show you how to avoid many common mistakes so that you can get the most out of your get-ups. We’re going to break it down so that you can practice this exercise safely and effectively in your own workouts and in the group sessions you might already be attending. You will also learn how the get-up and its component parts can be programmed as nearly infinite variations within workouts. The last hour will be dedicated to Q&amp;A, practice, and of course individual problem solving.
Bring a water bottle and hand towel. Kettlebells will be provided. I will have new, in box Dragon Door kettlebells in various useful sizes available for purchase at the event (contact me if you would like to purchase one ahead of time and I will reserve it for you. Dragon Door 8kg, 12kg, 16kg, and 20kg kettlebells will be available: info@giryagirl.com )

Question of the Week!
Question of the week – is Convict Conditioning ok for women?
Absolutely! It’s mindboggling how often this question comes up, but I guess with all of the masculine words and marketing it may be confusing… especially compared to what normally is marketed to women in terms of fitness. Don’t get me started, I just can’t be bothered with that stuff. Anyway, the real power of Convict Conditioning and by extension the Progressive Calisthenics Workshops like the PCC and SCC which are based o"

One Year No Beer | Hack your healthy Lifestyle,"The OYNB podcast will inspire you to take, or support you through a 28, 90 or 365 day alcohol-free challenge. Transform your life by changing your relationship with alcohol. Kick start your healthy habits and reconnect with your true self. When it comes to raising children, you have to make your moments count, because your child will only be a child for so long. Parents know this, but many find it harder than they expected to get in the quality time that they and their children need. And worries about doing it wrong can lead some parents not to even try. 
 Today’s guest joins the podcast to talk about intentional parenting. Justin Batt is the founder of Daddy Saturday, an organization designed to help dads raise good kids to become great adults. Justin explains how Daddy Saturday got started – his wife was getting started establishing her own business, and Justin found himself in the position of being the primary parent on most Saturdays. He noticed that these Saturdays didn’t always result in the kind of time he wanted to spend with his children, despite good intentions, so he decided to make a change. 
 “It starts with you as the parent first, and you modeling for your kids what you want to see in them.”
 Justin started making plans to engage with his children in an intentional way. With a plan of action in place, not only did Saturdays go more smoothly, but Justin found that he was able to be really present with his children, not just physically, but emotionally as well. 
 It didn’t take long for Justin to discover that he was not the only father experiencing similar things, and he set out to find a way to use his own engagement with his children to help out other fathers as well. This is what led to Daddy Saturdays. 
 In today’s episode, Justin explains how he began helping other fathers develop plans for engaging with their children and how that intention helped relationships improve. He also discussed his research into the problem of fatherlessness, including how fathers can sometimes be present in the household but not emotionally available for their children, and how that affects children and families. He also discusses his own experiences with alcohol and giving it up. Listen in to learn more about Justin, Daddy Saturday, and intentional parenting.

 Daddy Saturday: https://daddysaturday.com/ 
info@daddysaturday.com Mark Williamson says that he came from a privileged background – not in the sense that he came from wealth, but in the sense that he came from a loving family and enjoyed a happy, carefree childhood. Initially, Mark saw himself pursuing a scientific path. He studied engineering and became interested in understanding how to fix things and how the world works. This interest led him to finish a degree in electronics and pursue a Ph.D. He also worked on developing WiFi technology.
 However, Mark realized that he fundamentally enjoyed making connections with other humans, and he just wasn’t getting the human contact that he wanted from science or academia. So he decided to pursue another path. He went into management consulting but found that this career didn’t make him happy either. He liked the people he worked with but didn’t enjoy the job itself. 
 “What I realized on that journey is that it’s not just the planet that’s broken, our culture is broken.”
 It was during this period of his life that Mark began to develop debilitating back pain. He would wake up in the morning unable to get out of bed. He stopped running and participating in sports activities. He was told that he had a degenerative spine disease and that he might be in a wheelchair by the time he reached his forties. During this time, his wife, who was training to be an osteopath, gave him a book introducing him to the idea that emotional stress might contribute to physical pain. This led Mark to quit the job and pursue a new path. 
 Although Mark was on the path that would lead to him becoming the co-founder and director of Action for Happiness, that didn’t happen right away. Mark went back to school and got an MBA, but he wanted to use his skills and knowledge to do something with a social purpose. So, he spent five years working on the problem of climate change with Carbon Trust first. 
 It was this work that made him realize that the problem wasn’t just the environment that was in trouble, it was the culture. So Mark set out to find a way to improve the culture, which was what led him to found Action for Happiness. In today’s interview, Mark talks about thinking of success in terms of happiness, not income, discovering the things that really matter in life, and helping others do the same. He also discusses his status as a recovering people pleaser and his decision to take a break from alcohol. Listen in to hear more about Mark and his work, as well as how you can get involved with Action for Happiness.

 Mark Williamson - Director of Action for Happiness
 Action for Happiness: https://www.actionforhappiness.org/ Graham Roberts is a coach who believes that everyone is capable of anything. He believes that to change behaviour, one just has to figure out what makes people tick, why they make the decisions that they make, and how to ignite their motivation so that they’re able to achieve their aspirations.
 In today’s conversation between Graham and One Year No Beer’s Jen Fairbairns, Graham talks about starting his own business and the difficult decisions that he has had to make. Graham says that beginning his own business took a lot of soul searching. At the time he was only a little over a year into being a father, and going out on his own was a leap of faith.
 “The real strength of humankind is the ability to be authentic with the conversation that’s going on inside.”
 Graham works with organizations to transform the way that they work, and with world-class athletes to help them understand what they’re capable of achieving and how to go about it. According to Graham, authenticity is the key ingredient to success, and more importantly, to happiness. He sees it as a privilege when the people he works with make the space for him to be there with them and listen to them. 
 Graham believes that it’s important to put yourself in a position to explore and challenge your perspectives on the world. Graham himself does this by participating in adventure racing. He describes a recent event that he took part in – Rat Race’s Race to the Wreck in Namibia. He talks about the difficulty of biking through sand, the panic attack that he had on the fourth day of the race, and what he learned from the experience.
 Graham also talks about the advice that he would give to people who are working to give up alcohol. He talks about the importance of being fair with yourself, breaking a large goal into smaller, more manageable chunks, and why it’s important for people to understand that they do have choices. Listen in to the episode to hear more of what Graham has to say about changing behaviour and living honestly and authentically.

 Ispire Motivational Coaching
 Ispire on Instagram What happens when you quit your job to spend more time running ultramarathons? Just ask Chase and Nikki Parnell. Together, they’ve made big lifestyle changes and turned their love of running into a family activity. 
 Previously, Chase worked as a lawyer in Bend, Oregon. He was always interested in distance running and got into running ultramarathons about 8 years ago. He describes running as his passion. However, while Chase was still working as a lawyer, he was also a big drinker. Between that and the stress and hours of his job, his efforts to scrape by eventually came crashing down. He decided it was time to make a life change. Chase had heard Andy interviewed on a podcast and was inspired by the dialogue, and that encouraged him to get into the OYNB community. Chase quit drinking, and he also quit his job. 
 Chase’s wife, Nikki, is also a runner. Chase got her interested in ultramarathons, and she’s found ways to not only get involved in running and in the ultramarathon community but also ways to include their children as well. Nikki says that they enjoy it and that it’s good for them to see their parents show up and say yes to something that’s difficult. 
 “It’s fun to discover what you can and can’t do.” – Chase Parnell
 Chase says that abstaining from alcohol has improved his training. Although Chase is relatively new to One Year No Beer, he says that just waking up without a mild hangover in the mornings is a big improvement. 
 In today’s interview, Chase and Nikki talk about their Treeline Journal, where they write about running, marathoning, and their family. They discuss managing their relationship now that they work together and run together, what their goals are, and how they fit into the ultramarathoning community. Listen in to hear more about what Chase and Nikki are doing and how giving up alcohol has made a difference in their lives.

 Treeline Journal:  https://treelinejournal.com/about-us-chase-parnell-nikki-parnell/ Which is better for health and weight loss, paleo or veganism? Is one diet really better than all the others? Or is weight loss more about mindset and what works for you as an individual, rather than about finding the one correct diet plan? And what is it that causes disordered eating or just a seeming inability to lose the weight that you want to lose in order to look and feel your best? Today’s interview will address some of those questions.
 Today’s guest is Adele Tevlin, who has devised a revolutionary weight loss program and created a coaching business to help business executives manage their weight for life. Her goal is to help bridge the gap between what people know and what they actually do. 
 “There’s always something in the background that’s holding us back from achieving our level of greatness.”
 Adele knew from an early age that she wanted a career that would allow her to help people. At one point, she was gearing up to follow in her mother’s footsteps and attend dental school, but she realized that wasn’t quite the way that she wanted to help people. So, Adele studied neuroscience in college. Additionally, she had a background as a ballet dancer, which meant that she spent time around women who had eating disorders. She was curious about why some people struggle with mental health issues while others are resilient to them, and she brought this curiosity into her life’s work.
 In today’s episode, Adele talks about actionable ideas that can help people eat better and lose weight, like planning ahead so that they don’t end up overeating or grabbing unhealthy food just because it’s fast and easy. She discusses the importance of identifying your own blind spots and finding healthy food options wherever you happen to be, as well as the importance of choosing a diet plan that works for your individual body and circumstances. 
 Adele also discusses why it can be so difficult to make needed changes, even when someone has a lot of pain that could be addressed by making those changes. She posits that for some people, the pain points still might just not be high enough, and explains how narratives or imprints that people have about themselves may affect how much effort they’re willing to put into losing weight and how successful they are, as well as how people can address those negative imprints. 
 Adele talks about how cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is action-oriented and focused on the present and the future, and why she finds CBT to be a useful tool in helping people address weight loss and other issues. She also discusses the idea that successes come with a cost, the lasting effects of trauma in childhood, and the benefits of mindfulness and meditation. Listen in to hear more details about Adele’s philosophy and work.

 Elevating Leadership: http://ceoblueprint.co/home Can changing your morning routine change your life? And what do you have to do to not only grow on a personal level, but also get out of your comfort zone, challenge yourself, and achieve your larger goals? Those are the things that you’re going to hear about from today’s guest Hal Elrod, author of The Miracle Morning and a new book, The Miracle Equation.
 Hal starts by talking about his first book, The Miracle Morning. However, as Hal explains, the idea for the Miracle Morning wasn’t really a book idea at all to begin with. The idea originated after the crash in the US economy in 2007. Hal says that his own life went into a spiral along with the economy. So, he began looking up habits and rituals of successful people. Much of the information he came across referenced morning routines, but Hal himself wasn’t much of a morning person. But he decided to give it a try. 
 “The miracle is always inevitable when you live by the miracle equation.”
 Hal came up with a list of six practices. At first, he was going to try only one, but then he decided to see what would happen if he tried all of them. He anticipated needing to put this change into practice for six to twelve months before seeing any results – but he saw dramatic changes in only two months. His wife dubbed the practice his “miracle morning” and the six practices became the acronym SAVERS: Silence (meditation), Affirmations, Visualization, Exercise, Reading, and Scribing (journaling). It took Hal three years to finish writing The Miracle Morning.
 Hal also talks about his newest book, The Miracle Equation. As he describes it, the concept of the miracle morning is the process for daily personal development, but that by itself is not enough to get a person out of their comfort zone so that they can achieve larger goals. The process for doing that is what Hal lays out in The Miracle Equation.
 Hal explains the rearview mirror effect – how people can come to believe that they can’t accomplish a thing because they look in their personal “rearview mirror” and see that they haven’t achieved that thing before. He also talks about the importance of having faith in yourself, the four steps to effective affirmations, and what to do when you’re stuck dwelling on something in the past that you can’t change. Listen to the interview to hear more about Hal and The Miracle Equation.

You can follow Kirsten at @shelovestorun and she's also our head coach over at Run Club, where she also writes custom programs.
One of the big questions that came for Kirsten after her first unsupported 100km run was how she managed her mindset and her mental headspace through such a long event, with a whole heap of challenges and battling a whole lot of fatigue. So this is the main area that we dive into today.

This week from podcast land . . .
At the end of the year, it's natural to reflect on what went really well, and what didn't work so well and it's a great time to take a step back and examine what you want to continue doing because it's working really well and what you'd like to work on more. An important part of that process is:
Creating a context for your improvement: running can be really black and white in terms of outcomes, but not all improvements can be measured in a time or a PB
Understanding that sometimes you don't need to change anything, you just need to keep going
Creating a balance between developing work capacity and specific training
How to zone in on things that might be blocking your progress: like over-training or under-recovering

I talk about things like: are you better off getting as much sleep, or following a consistent schedule? Should you take that nap? How do you set up routines to put yourself on auto-pilot? Is some sleep more valuable than other sleep? And is being a night owl a real thing?

Goal races for experience vs for PBs
Structuring your year around your goals
The differences when you are planning for an ultra vs planning for a shorter distance
And then we get sidetracked into other things like: you can run even if it doesn't benefit your family at all.

Or you can listen on iTunes, Spotify or Stitcher. podcast: episode 113 – training talk with kirsten and what happens when you don’t adapt to training
November 1, 2019 //  by OperationMove//  Leave a Comment

In this week’s podcast, Kirsten is back and we go long!
We catch up on what does a big training week look like when you are about to run 100km, and what we’ve both been up to. She’s in full training mode, but I’ve taken everything down a notch for the year.
We tackle the big question: what happens if you do the training plan, log all the workouts, and you don’t get the outcome you wanted?
We talk about:
Setting a reasonable expectation in the first place
How to make sure that you have more than one goal, so it’s not all locked into one time
Focusing on trends, rather than one result
How to evaluate if it is the training plan that’s not quite right for what you need to work on, or if it’s just that you haven’t given it enough time yet
And the even bigger question: what would you do if you were never going to improve?

Or you can listen on iTunes, Spotify or Stitcher. I’m back, it just took me a little while with school holidays, a race, two short weeks and life, you know?
So this episode is all about how to let go of your A goal, and still have your race or your event be the celebration of your training that you want it to be.
Because as it turns out after Melbourne, that’s something that I know a little bit about.
Honestly, this podcast is a bit of a rambling one, so I won’t attempt to summarise it, you’ll just have to have a listen.

Ordinary Marathoner,"Running a marathon is an extraordinary accomplishment that more and more people are checking off of their bucket lists every year.  I have completed a few, but I'm no more special than anyone.  In fact, I think I'm just ordinary. Does all that Whole-30 Diet Mumbo-Jumbo really work?  Well, maybe.  I have a bit of a different theory.  It’s actually more common sense.  It’s the combination of consistent training and diet discipline actually works!







I’ve been crushing it so far this year.  We are loosely following the Whole-3o dietary framework, but have taken a few small liberties here and there.  And no, I’m not starting over because I like to weigh myself daily or because I had a few glasses of red wine with the steaks we grilled the other night.  But there is something to be said for daily training, early morning wake-ups, and grabbing the fruit instead of the Oreos.







In recent weeks, I’ve been more focused than ever.  Typically I find that might happen if I have a big goal-race coming up later in the year, but I don’t have that in 2020.  There’s nothing I’m doing that I haven’t done before.  So what is the difference in this year?







I think it’s the support of the community and the athletes I am coaching.  I told myself I’d try to be more social with my training this year, and I certainly have been doing just that.  Group rides,  more discussions with athletes who have high aspirations – it all helps keep me going.

Full of positive energy and possessing a kind spirit, she sets lofty goals and goes after them.  It’s hard to believe that in 2016 she started her running career by “Running to the mailbox.”  Look at her now – finishing 100k races!







Today we sit down and discuss ultrarunning with Tamra Johnson.  How she started, why she started, and what gives her the drive to keep going.  Even after missing the distance twice in the past, she never gave up.  She continues to amaze, and what’s next in her future?  A 100-miler did she say?  This crazy lady actually has me wondering if maybe there’s an ultra in my future, too.







Note the word “maybe.”







I SAID MAYBE!

Ok, so you’ve been hammering away at those New Year’s Resolutions.  Desperately grabbing onto those positive changes to your old routine.  Old, bad habits out!  New, good habits in!  Well, it’s time to at least acknowledge that you’re doing a great job.







By now, most resolutions have either died an early death or have started to develop into something of a routine.  It’s becoming less difficult to fit things in, to make the right choices.  You’re just doing it.  So, congratulations!







And if thing aren’t going your way?  Well, don’t give up!  Even though this is the last time I talk about resolutions until next year.  From now on, it’s just a promise you made to yourself.  And if it hasn’t gone well, or if you wish you had made different promises – well, then make them now!  It’s never too late.

This morning was tough.  It’s not easy to get up early every day when you’re not used to doing it.  Some days are easier than others, but the best thing you can do is set yourself up to succeed.  Getting good sleep, being prepared for the morning, being held accountable to yourself and, if necessary, to others.







14 days into 2020 and so-far, so-good. 







This morning was a tough one for me.  Technology breakdowns and other distractions can get in the way and make you want to quit.  Always have an alternative plan – don’t shut down.  Just do something else and stay productive.

How else can he possibly do all that he does?  He writes books, he carves medal racks from wood, and he finishes Ultramarathons.  How does he find the time?







Well for one, he’s a Cleveland Browns fan.  Typically the month of January is free.







Alright, alright… I’m joking.  (But I’m not.)  Brian has always been a generous sponsor to the Ordinary Marathon.  He sits down with us this week to talk about how he does all that he does and fits in in his schedule.

There’s a reason why the gym rats hate the first two weeks of a new year.  It’s because you’re hogging up all the good parking spots and using the machines they use!  But see… they’re not worried.  Because history tells us that in four days, you won’t be going to the gym anymore.  Why is that?  It’s the Rule of Two Weeks.  Your job?  Make sure it does not apply to you!







Did you know that 75% of people prefer to train alone than in groups?







Yeah, I was shocked too!







Sometimes things like motivation, inspiration, and discipline are enough.  As an athlete in an individual sport, you may not need more that that.  You might even think that training in a group could hold you back.  And you know what?  You might be right.







But during the times when it isn’t enough.  When you keep hitting snooze.  When that bottle of wine at night is worth more than that workout in the morning.  Maybe you need that additional accountability.  When you played on that high school team, did you miss practice often?  Did you leave practice early?







I think this is what we have been developing lately.  This close-knit athletic community in an individualistic sport needs a place to come together.  As Dave Chappelle (and Miles Davis) said here (caution: language, of course):  “It took me years to learn how to play like myself.”







I think we’re finally learning.

Our Wellness Blueprint Podcast,"Our Wellness Blueprint Podcast was started by two personal trainers who have been in the fitness industry for a combined of 10+ years and have knowledge in the field for 25+ years. We quickly realized that A LOT of people struggle to stay fit and healthy because they do not know the principles of training, health and well-being. When they do decide to get into it they usually go to the extreme and tend to fall out of routine and give up. This is the first mistake and that is why we are here. We want to teach and show people that having an active and healthy lifestyle is much easier than it looks and sounds. We cover all aspects of fitness and well being, not just the gym. We will discuss diets, training methods, psychology, well-being, motivation, life coaching, basic lifestyle changes that anyone can apply. Season 1 and 2019 has officially wrapped! What a journey and adventure it has been for myself, Sebastien Mahiat And my  co-host Ricardo Dos Santos. We go back and take a look at our journey as well as the few moments that stood out. We also let you know what our future goal and vision is with the podcast and what changes you can expect for season 2 and 2020! Thank you to all who have joined us so far. Your love and support has been amazing In a society where we spend most of our time sitting and hunched over most of the day, if its over your food, your phone, your steering wheel,  or your computer, and in a world where everyone is trying to get fitter and healthier, we are more and more prone to injuries. We brought our special guest Caryn Stretton, a Harvard graduate in physiotherapy to discuss why people are getting more and more injuries and what we can do to avoid these situations and better deal with it. Join us in today's episode where we discuss the most common injuries in her practice, advice on what to look out for and how to handle them. The new Netflix Documentary ""Game Changers"" has hit the scene with a lot of controversy. Many are making a change to veganism out of fear from the data that was presented to them. Is it really all that it seems? have we been lied to all this time? Join us with our guest speaker Melissa Bosch as we discuss some of the findings that were presented and why you might want to think twice before accepting this documentary at face value. We discuss how the pros and cons of being a vegan and help you with scientific based evidence, if this move will be the right choice for you. Jarryd Smith, a motivational speaker who grew up being addicted to drugs and living on the streets, to flipping his life 180 degrees and helping others. Founder of Second Chance Trust.


Second Chance Trust is a public benefit organisation that educates young people on the dangers of alcohol and substance abuse and empowers them with knowledge and skills to make healthy life choices. It also facilitates interventions that promote healing and growth in victims of social issues such as rape, HIV, abuse and gangsterism - which are very often associated directly or indirectly with drug and alcohol abuse.


The Trust was founded by Jarryd Smith who has lived through, survived and overcome chronic addiction. In addition to his role as founder and Program Director, Jarryd is the author of a highly acclaimed autobiography entitled 180º Had to die. To live. This hard hitting autobiography is a brutally honest account of his downward spiral into the sordid world of hard core drugs and his excruciatingly painful journey back to a healthy and productive life. In today's episode, we decided to go into the mind rather than the body, as to what makes a person who they are. We discuss the basic principles of the Id, Ego and superego, and how they all interact with each other to create you. Join us as we break down the human psyche and hopefully give you some insight as to why you might behave or react in certain way when presented with a situation. Probably one of the worst thing that can happen when you are on role in your fitness journey is receiving an injury. All that hard work being set back by a simple ankle twist or a pulled muscle. Even just 2 weeks of rest can set you back on your hard work. Some have continuous problems for months after. So in today's episode we discuss some of the practices that you can implement in your routine to avoid getting injured while exercising."
Outside The Jyim Podcast,"Fitness / Health / Wellness The information overload.

Let me start by saying I am not a nutritionist. I am a CPT who covered fundamental aspects of nutrition. I have read a few books about food and consult with nutritionists regularly. No-one, not even a professional should have the final say on what you put in your body. The information that specialists provide are just suggestions. If you try a Vegan diet and your body doesn't feel well, then do yourself a favor and stop. If you are on a high protein meat eating diet and your body doesn't feel well, then please just stop. Do not let anyone force you into following their path or their journey, that path or journey is for them, not you.

My personal opinion is that anything excessive is going to be potentially damaging. If you eat an excessive amount of meat or carbs the potential for a negative impact exists.

My suggestion is that you combine the information you receive from reputable sources with how you feel and come to your own well informed conclusion. I HAVE TO TELL MYSELF THIS EVERYDAY

Sleep is more important and more efficient. I have to be honest; this is probably the hardest thing for me to understand. No, like really I'm a fiend, I'm writing this when I should be leaving it undone to get some rest. So let's have a moment together. What's more efficient? Staying up after a long day, trying to read the same sentence for 3 hours, or going to sleep waking up and reading a page in 2 hours. Do the math. The brain is just not as efficient when it is sleep deprived. 

I have accomplished everything in my life by taking pride in working when everyone else is sleeping. It's crucial we don't lose that, so there will be moments we pull those all-nighters and grind like crazy. We just have to find balance. WE HAVE TO CHOOSE OUR BATTLES. I humbly offer this next bit of advice, please be honest and ask yourself one question...can this wait until tomorrow? If it can wait, then take your ass to sleep! A few dishes in the sink, A report that's due in 5 days, A new project, etc... 

The funny thing is, by making sleep a priority it forces us to be even more productive during the day because we have a hard deadline to get to bed at a specific time. It's your anniversary, if you're not married, then it's your best friends birthday. It's an event for the person you absolutely care about the most. Your friend or partner has a favorite dessert. For the sake of this convo let's assume it's vegan. Don't fix up your face; it's about your friend, not you. Ok now back to the story. 

Your partner's event is on Monday you're able to make it to the bakery on Friday. When you get to the bakery, you realize you actually know the owner. You explain to her that you need a special Vegan cake. She responds that she has one left and can have it delivered on the Monday before the event. But she also gives you another option. She offers to come by Saturday and teach you how to make the cake yourself. It will take a few hours, but she's positive she can show you how to make the cake. You appreciate the offer but tell her it would take too long to learn how to make the cake so to have it delivered.

Monday comes, the big day!! The bakery shows up with their last available Vegan Cake that you know will make the event a smash! On the way up the stairs, the cake gets dropped and destroyed.

You got the cake you reached your goal, but you never learned how to achieve it. It seemed like it would have taken longer to learn how to make the cake but now with the cake destroyed the bakery can't get another cake until Wednesday. If you learned how to make the cake, you had enough time to get the ingredients and make it before the event. The process just seems more prolonged, but trust me it's not. The results will come, as soon as you stop worrying about 'em!"
Over The Top Cycling,"Over the Top Cycling (http://www.overthetop.bike) is a Colorado/California based news, events, broadcast and coaching based bicycling company delivering information specifically related to road racing and ultra endurance. A group of Seattle Randonneurs decided to create an unofficial challenge to honor the memory of one of their own, Don Boothby, who passed away before he got a chance to complete a 300k ride every month of the year, Hence the Boothby Challenge was created.

4 riders completed it in 2014

Randonneuring is long-distance unsupported endurance cycling. This style of riding is non-competitive in nature, and self-sufficiency is paramount. Participation in randonneuring events is part of a long tradition that goes back to the beginning of the sport of cycling in France and Italy.

PaddyTalks,"Welcome to PaddyTalks, brought to you thanks to www.SeedGolf.com. What is the Show about? I love sport, more specifically golf and those who play it. I have a massive interest into the mind and into the life of Touring professionals, PGA pro's, the top amateurs of the game, but maybe more so I love learning about why people from all walks of life, business and sport and why we play this game of golf. It’s kind of like an unofficial official show, so there will be a structure somewhat but the vibe I’m going for is basically for the listener, that you are listening in on a couple of people having the chats in the kitchen, or in the snug of a pub. A nice relaxed environment where we just want to tell and listen to stories about this game we all love. There are some key topics I’d like to cover personally, but would love to hear what topics you would like to hear discussed and with who! So get into the comments on this show wherever you are listening to it, actually let me know where you are listening to it so I know too! It won’t be just me all the time, I’m looking forward to having my mates and indeed any willing co-hosts please get in touch as from from time to time, when calendars allow, to preview and review the top tournaments as well as discuss certain areas of the game in an in-depth but relaxed format. This episode has been months in the making!

PATH Positive Approaches To Health,"PATH is a cross-country road trip navigated by registered dietitians and long-time friends Jenny and Toni. PATH spotlights America’s diverse subcultures—in communities from Berkeley to Birmingham—revealing some surprising and practical roads to healthier living for ourselves and the nation. PATH is our Positive Approach To Health. Ride along with us!To access show notes, recipes, resources and pics of our awesome pups check us out at:https://www.thepathpod.com/ In this episode, Toni and Jenny take a profound and meaningful journey into the heart-space to learn why it is so important to forgive. They had a wonderful conversation with Dr. Fred Luskin, founder and director of the Stanford University Forgiveness Projects. Dr. Luskin explains some of the challenges forgiveness presents and why many people find it so incredibly difficult. He also lays out a simple, 4-step plan for initiating the practice of forgiveness. It is a powerful tool that all of us should have at our disposal - not only for our emotional health but for our physical health as well. To read more about the life-altering work Dr. Luskin has engaged in with people all over the world, along with his books and audio content, check out https://learningtoforgive.com/ We go down under (not really, our expert was in Toni's office in San Jose!) on this virtual road trip to learn more about meditation. We spoke with meditation teacher Tami Roos and learned so much! If any of you are wondering about meditation and what the benefits are as well as how to start your own practice, this episode is for you!! There is a ton of research in this area and Tami breaks it down beautifully. She even leads a short, simple and effective guided meditation that you can use to start a daily practice. She also gives great ideas for how to deepen your current practice if you are that far in. She was an absolute delight to talk to and we know you will enjoy listening to this uplifting and hopeful conversation! You can check out all of Tami's work at https://www.tamiroos.com/, including her books, blog posts and meditations. Ride along with us on this PATH! To celebrate the start of the new year, we are browsing another book! This time it is a brand new cookbook, hot off the press! Half The Sugar, All the Love is a collaboration between Jennifer Tyler Lee and Anisha Patel, MD that launched this month and is already the #1 seller in cooking with kids! Toni and Jenny sat down with Jennifer, who is an award winning author to talk about her new book. They discussed cutting down on sugar (not ELIMINATING it!), how to sweeten foods with plants and modeling healthy behaviors for our kids. It was a fun conversation that went by quick! This is a great resource full of delicious recipes to help you and your family cut down on sugar. And it's not just desserts - you will find recipes for every meal of the day with helpful strategies, tips and tricks! You can find a copy at your local bookstore or online. For more information about the book or to check out Jennifer's work:
https://www.52newfoods.com/half-sugar-cookbook/ Toni and Jenny learn all about Functional Mental Toughness (fMT) during their conversation with Dr. Brad Cooper. Brad explains what lead him to this research and how his own findings helped his performance as an endurance athlete, a researcher and a business leader. Brad sheds a lot of light on how anyone can build fMT - it is a skill that can be practiced and  harnessed when needed. This is an episode that is sure to inspire as we start not only a new year, but a new decade - 2020, with a new VISION to guide us on our PATHS. Ride along with us!

http://www.CatalystCoachingInstitute.com Toni travels to NYC for her much needed Broadway fix and spends some time with a dear friend, Martin Navarrette. Martin shares a lovely tale about finding the right balance for his health and well-being and how connection, community, creativity and collaboration helped him forge this new PATH. We think this is the best gift we could give to our listeners today. The gift of finding your power - how one person decided it was time for a change, connected with others and is now thriving in one of the biggest cities in the world. And, he did it on his own terms. Martin talks about his community - the Lightning Society, you can follow them on Insta or at https://www.lightningsociety.com/. He talks about Urbanzen and how this organization is helping others heal all over the world. Check out their work at https://urbanzen.org/
He also mentions The Big Quiet, a massive meditation movement:
https://thebigquiet.com/
and how this is part of the Medi Club in NYC - found here: https://www.instagram.com/mediclubmediclub/?hl=en. 
These are alternative therapies that are more mainstream than you first might think and are a fascinating illustration of how many are taking this PATH and discovering their Positive Approach To Health. Ride along with us on this journey to NYC! Toni chats with Melanie Larsen about her experience presenting at Women's Night Out in Santa Rosa, California. Women's Night Out is a collaboration between Kaiser Permanente and The YMCA and has been thriving for over a decade. During the debrief between Toni and Melanie, they discuss how connection, community and collaboration are what bring these women together year after year to eat, talk and share. Through their conversation, they determine that it is the power of STORY that allows for ""making things happen"". Just as Toni uses story in this podcast, her presentation was a story about mindfulness and letting go to let things open up and just be. Toni shares how you, our listeners can bring a ""Women's Night Out"" to your part of the world to share, make connection and create community all in the name of health and well-being.

http://thrv.me/avenucoco I had the pleasure to sit down with Eric Grimsley, a StrongFirst instructor/ Original Strength coach/ Personal trainer/ kettlebell lover and we had the opportunity to talk shop.

What started out as a kettlebell conversation became one of how movement can set people free.  Free from the restraints of injury, sickness, and feeling like crap.

In this episode we talk about:
-What true ""strength"" is
-Why the kettlebell is an elite tool for cardio, fat loss, and strength building
-How to find a good KB instructor

@egrims59 Our culture is OBSESSED with the idea of losing fat.  We crash diet, cut calories, workout like madmen and restrict ourselves until we can't take it anymore.  All in the name of better health.

It might be time....no wait, it is time to look a little deeper.  Time to check out some biology.  We will begin with leptin.  Leptin is the hormone that controls hunger and satiety.  If leptin is off, you won't be burning fat like you want to.

Check out this quick hitting podcast to understand the mechanism of what leptin is, how it affects weight loss, and what the next song on my album will be!

Hit up the website!
https://pbandgainz.wordpress.com With the new year comes the resolutions and goals.  Typically those goals include some form of eating better and losing weight.  

Well...I want you to do something different this year: make a commitment to make a lasting change instead of giving yourself a deadline.  Don't plan on stopping after 21 days or 30 days.  

Rethink your diet plan and enjoy the long lasting success that follows!

For more information on Nicole Fennell, RD go check out www.chewsfoodwisely.com This is the episode in which we take on the ""New Years Resolution"".  The thing is though, I want you to stick with it this year.

Make 2016 the GOAT (Greatest of All Time).  Make simple changes to ensure that you are successful.  If you are looking to improve in 2016, make sure you listen to this episode.

You have the power to make 2016 the most authentically bada$$ year ever.  I will set you up on how to do it. 

This quote says it all:
""I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something."" -Neil Gaiman This episode is all about YOGA.  No, this isn't a ""hippy-dippy"" conversation.  It is one to help you understand that yoga can be an incredible tool in helping you learn how to breathe (I bet you are doing it wrong).

I chatted with Hailey, the yoga instructor at Avenu Fitness, who broke down the ancient study of yoga in a way a lamen like me could understand.

We chatted about:
-The true art of connection 
-The importance of breathing
-If yoga pants are required for yoga classes

Pediatric Sports Medicine Podcast,"Covering hot topics and recent research in the world of the young athlete relevant to healthcare professionals. Hosted by Dr. Mark Halstead  

In order to better understand someone and how they came to be the person that they are, an origin story so to speak, sort of like how a hero or villain in comic books are revealed to readers, can help make things more clear and hopefully make the topic or character more interesting. My origin story may or may not be of great interest to our listeners, but it does involve our first guest to the podcast.

Join me, Dr. Mark Halstead, as I speak with Dr. Greg Landry, a man who not only helped me become the physician I am today, but was also someone who helped blaze the trail for pediatric sports medicine. Come learn the “secret origins” of my early years in med school, the humble beginnings of our profession and what we think about the state of health for young athletes today during this episode of the Pediatric Sports Medicine Podcast.

— Dr. Mark Halstead https://www.ortho.wustl.  

This podcast has been a long time coming. For at least the last five years, I’ve talked and thought about starting a podcast covering topics in pediatric sports medicine. So, here I am. I’ve partnered with a dear friend from high school to help produce our podcast. And now my vision is finally becoming a reality.

I’m your host, Dr. Mark Halstead. I’ve been practicing sports medicine with a focus on the pediatric athlete for the past 15 years in St Louis. I plan on bringing my clinical experience and expertise in the area of pediatric sports medicine to this podcast. I will strive to make this your go to source whether you’re a practicing physician, athletic trainer, physical therapist, nutritionist, chiropractor, or any health care professional who deals with kids…..and even if you are a curious parent or coach who wants to get a deeper take on the current research and hot topics relevant to young athletes today this podcast will be for you.

I know there are plenty of medical podcasts out there. I’ve certainly listened to many of them and have been a guest on a few as well. Occasionally you may have pediatric sports medicine topics covered on them but that’s not typically their sole focus. I will focus on the high school and younger athlete and cover a wide variety of topics, talking with the country’s experts who work with these young athletes. I plan to discuss concussions, overuse injuries, nutrition, mental health, sports specialization and so much more. The sky’s the limit and I’m really excited to be able to get this project started.

Personal Trainer Podcast,"Con: Roberto PusinelliEsperto in dimagrimento e Anti AgingAutore di ""Torna in forma in 12 settimane"" Owner Undertraining SAGL Società di Personal Training 🆕 Il peso dell'apnea: quanto incide il tuo peso corporeo sulla prestazione? 🆕

Hai mai pensato a quanto possa incidere il tuo peso corporeo sulla durata delle tue apnee?

Nel video parliamo di peso corporeo e apnea, valutando nello specifico le componenti di massa magra e massa grassa e le loro differenti incidenze sulla pesata.  
All'interno troverai:

🔴 le % corrette di massa grassa 

🔴 le differenze tra muscolo e grasso

🔴 come comportarti per non perdere tempo durante la preparazione

Quali altri argomenti ti piacerebbe trattare?

Scrivicelo sul gruppo Facebook --&gt; https://www.facebook.com/groups/395543201132642/ Conoscere quali sono le caratteristiche che un apneista deve migliorare per diventare un atleta di alto livello ti permetterà di focalizzarti su ciò che è davvero importante per raggiungere il risultato.

Oggi, Roberto Pusinelli e Livia Bregonzio ti raccontano quali sono i punti sui quali devi assolutamente lavorare. Ciao,

ti è mai capitato di fare tutta la preparazione fisica in maniera impeccabile ma di non ottenere il risultato desiderato nel giorno più importante, quello della gara?

Hai mai avuto pensieri negativi durante una competizione? 
Del tipo: 

""ora mi raggiunge""
""non ce la farò mai""
""sono troppo vecchio per batterlo""

Beh, se anche solo una di queste o altre frasi negative ti sono balenate almeno una volta nella testa, benvenuto nel club!

Anche io come ex atleta nazionale e vincitore di svariati titoli nazionali, ho perso molte sfide per colpa di queste frasi ""distruttive"".

Per questo motivo ho deciso di invitare nel nostro studio il Dr. Mauro Lucchetta, Psicologo dello sport che ci spiega come impostare una preparazione mentale per vincere la nostra sfida.

 Ci teniamo a dirvi giusto 2 cose:
① Chi siamo
② Perchè questo titolo e di cosa parleremo"
"Personal Training, Mindset &amp; Nutrition Coaching","Spent the last years focussing on your career and business, but now realise you need to focus on your body, before it's too late? This podcast is for you. It's that time of year, where we're gonna see a lot of us try and make changes and a lot of us are gonna find it hard to stick to it, past the first four weeks of this year.

Now one of the reasons it is so hard, is that we try and do the same thing we've been doing before and getting the same result we've gotten before.

You'll walk into a gym, any gym and you'll see how busy it is now compared to in two months, maybe even one months time.

It's going to be packed with those same people that are making that same resolution every year to try and make a change.

But they keep doing the same thing over and over again.

If we're taking that same action we've taken before, the future is probably gonna be the same as it is right now.

How do we make a change on this? How do we actually make progress on something we haven't done before? The first thing is doing something different.

Don't do the same thing again, don't go back to the same place, the same environment that's giving you the same result.

Start something new. Today we're going to talk about the two main types of goals we can have, and how to use them to get results.



Pain vs Pleasure

The first type of goal - and often the strongest one - is a negative goal - that’s when we’re changing something because we’re not happy where we are.

This is a really common reason for people to start training.

Often, new clients get in touch because they’re in a situation that they're not happy with - either they feel discomfort with something in their life right now, or they feel it’s coming down the tracks.

The most common ones are weight gain, injury or illness, or the fear of any of these happening in the future.

The biggest reason that most people start, especially with training and fitness, is to get out of pain.



New Year Blues

A lot people will experience this in the New Year, for several reasons. The end of the year often prompts us to look back and review, and of course to make the old New Years’ resolutions. Combined with this, January arrives on the back of what is for most people a period of indulgence over the holidays. This is compounded this year, as we’re starting a new decade. The upshot of all this is that a lot of people are gonna be unhappy with how they look, how they feel, and the way they've treated their body, over the last month, year, or decade, and will want to make a change.

That's where gym memberships spike.



Positive Goals

The second type of goal is being pulled towards happiness, rather than pushed away from pain.

That's where we're happy where we currently are and we want to get even better.

We're not in a bad place, we're not in danger of something terrible happening any time soon, but we do want to improve.

This could be building muscle in specific areas, it could be generating more energy at certain times of the day, it could be working towards an event that's coming down the line, whether that’s a race or a social event.



Out of the flying pan vs. lighting a fire



An analogy of all this is a burning building.

If you’re inside a burning building all you want to do is get out. Simple.

Fear or desperation will drive you out. You’ll take action. You’ll do something radical to get out of danger.

Once you’re out, and not in pain anymore, this is actually the danger point…

What often happens here is that once the immediate fear subsides, you’ll start to backslide. Being driven from fear will only get you so far. Little by little, the weight will creep back. The energy will flag. The couple of drinks will increase. The takeaways will reappear.

This may sound familiar to you. Being spurred into action out of fear or self-loathing will only get you so far. It might get you through a bootcamp or a crash diet. It won’t keep you going.

What we do here, and what works again and again, is setting positive goals, and then building that habits that get you there, step by step.

This may be a slower path, but I can promise you from experience that it yields immeasurably better results.

Time after time I’ve seen clients achieve results they never would have dreamed of. If you put in the time, effort, and energy in a sustainable way, and then see the positive transformation happen in front of your eyes, do you think you’re turning back?

No way.

It’s a powerful turning point, when you can go from saying “I want to lose belly fat” to “Yeah I’m pretty happy with my figure - I’d love to be able to do more chin ups”. When you’re feeling confident and secure in your habits, you get sustained, predictable results, and you feel in control of eating, drinking and training, it’s pretty easy to set and reach more ambitious goals.

This could be you. I have never had a client that this didn’t work for, if they commit.



A word of warning…



This what will happen around your social circle if you do get out o We discuss whether you should wait until the New Year (or any time in the future) to start making changes to your health, fitness or body. Dave &amp; Deirdre Thomas who recently retired, wanted to enjoy the time they now had to the fullest. Unrestricted of movement and ability to do anything they wanted. They've made having a healthy and physically thriving body part of both their lives and in this episode you'll hear their story."

For most people they picture images of massive muscled, oiled up men in tight little bikini bottoms. Yes, these are body builders, and yes it is a competitive sport that many men and women around the world participate in, however, there is more to Bodybuilding that meets the eye. Bodybuilding is in fact what the word states: it is someone who seeks to build their body from the ground up. 
Today I'm joined with Sean Covell and Holly Covell. Sean is a Pro Bodybuilder and the Owner/CEO Fitness System Health Clubs. Holly is also a Pro Bodybuilder and a IFBB PRO Figure Competitor. As competitors and coaches in the space of body building and figure competition I wanted to bring them into talk how to train, what to eat, the mindset of the sport and the future of the sport.

We expanded the gym, twice, we had a kid, we started this podcast but more importantly, we've helped members lose a collective of 500lbs of fat and gain nearly 200lbs of muscle through our PAC Limitless Challenge.
THE PAC LIMITLESS CHALLENGE isn’t a 5 week “fast fix,”— it’s a system that, when implemented, can transform every corner of your life. We don’t believe in crash diets, “Off Limits” Food or unsustainable efforts that cause “yo-yoing” and ultimately more longterm damage. Through education, self-awareness, intuitive eating, and accountability you will build a defense against failure and ensure a rock-steady platform for success. From physical goals to psychological fortitude, this is the journey you need to develop a strong armor against the holidays and go into the New Year not even needing Resolutions.
This is our 7th challenge and this challenge is different. Different because we are extending this challenge outside the walls of Pharos Echo Park. You get a nutrition coach, you get a head coach and you have regular check-ins with all these coaches. You have endless support throughout the challenge from both the people within the challenge and from your coaches at Pharos
So heading into the New Year we are going to introduce to you our 6 Steps to achieving sustainable health and fitness in 2020 with The Pac Limitless Challenge.

Check out our website here for class times and follow us on Instagram for more fitness related content Feeling pain doesn’t mean your body has failed. In fact, it signals a body doing its job by letting you know something’s up. By heeding its wise (if blunt) counsel, you can effectively identify and deal with the cause.
For most of us, the natural response to pain signals is resistance—to push them away or deny that they even exist. Yet ignoring pain only serves to add an extra layer of angst to an already unpleasant situation. Not only do you still have the pain to deal with, but now you have to keep up the ruse that the pain isn’t really there. Inviting pain in is the first step to understanding how to come to terms with it. 
Today I'm joined with my co-owner and wife Emylee Covell co-owner of Pharos Athletic Club. Overcoming an unhealthy childhood of obesity, rheumatoid arthritis and hip dysplasia, Emylee sought a healthier life by challenging her preconceived notions of what her body was capable of. She has student Kinesiology at USC before and is certified in ACE, CMTC, Myokinesis Integration and CrossFit L1. 
Here at Pharos e do a lot of lifting, we do a lot of moving, we do a lot of running, and we do a lot of boxing. And as we know, the more things we do, the more things we need to recover from. So for today's episode, we sit down with Emylee Covell and talk about the best ways to prepare for and to recover from activity in and out of the gym.

Eating healthy can be fairly simple, however the rise in popular ""diets"" and dieting trends has caused confusion. These trends have distracted us from several basic nutrition principles; how many calories do I need a day, how much protein do any today, how much carbs and how much fats relative to that.
Today, I am joined by two members of our staff, Tyler Manzo and Alena Henke who share their personal dieting experiments and experiences from the ketogenic diet to the potato diet, where you eat only plain potatoes for three to five days.

Before we opened the doors to our own facility we noticed our friends and family owned multiple memberships around Los Angeles. They would do their yoga at one gym, their cycling at another and their CrossFit on the other side of town.
Gym members want to know they can lift, they want to be able to do their cardio, they want to work on their movement, and they even want to use machines to strengthen underdeveloped muscles.
So what we saw when we developed Pharos was an opportunity to put everything under one roof and make it more affordable. We believe in multiplicity. We believe there is a place for all these things. We don't have a dogma for first athletic club. It's not that is one way. It's that there are many ways and we all have our own.

Featuring some of the brightest minds in our industry, we'll dive in to deconstruct smart training, and help you or your athletes maximize results! Ever since he was a child, Radley Haddad has been passionate about baseball. 



Born and raised in Indiana, Radley started playing when he was six years old with his friends in their backyard. He played travel ball in high school and soon started his baseball career at West Carolina University, where he played for two years before transferring to Butler University. 



And eventually, after a ton of hard work, Radley got an opportunity to play in the Minor Leagues with the New York Yankees and, after his fourth season, became the team’s Major League Coaching Assistant &amp; Bullpen Catcher.

Thanks for tuning into this week’s episode of The Physi... An athlete’s triumph lies in more than just training inside the gym or following a routine.



After all, while many coaches take their clients and athletes follow specific training programs, not all of them achieve success on the field.



In that case, what separates good athletes from great ones?



What are the key factors that drive an athlete’s growth and development?



And how can coaches use those factors to ensure their athletes’ success?



In today’s episode, I share the four key ingredients necessary for ensuring your clients and athletes achieve success in and out of the gym. I explain how humility and communication skills can create the right training environment for athletes.



I illustrate how commitment to the process can lead an athlete toward success. And I also share my experiences of training with NBA professionals such as Roy Hibbert, Glenn Robinson, and Kelan Martin to illustrate how they achieved success in their careers.

Physio RXd,"Physical therapy & physical fitness are not and should not be mutually exclusive. As physical therapists and CrossFit coaches, we bring these two worlds together and discuss how both can work together in the fight against the growing epidemic that is chronic disease. Milwaukee local doctor of physical therapy/CrossFit L1, Guillermo Contreras and lifelong fitness nomad/CrossFit L1, Ryan Atkins, discuss movement, mobility, recovery, nutrition, sleep, conspiracy theories, energy drinks and more in hopes of bringing together the world of CrossFit and Physical Therapy in the battle against chronic disease. Dr. G, physical therapist, crossfit level 1 and crossfit athlete, dives into the topic of injuries and how they occur. He discusses load vs capacity and the importance of understanding these concepts to maximize your training, fitness and performance and minimize your risk of injury. Dr Guillermo and Coach Ryan get a little more heated than usual in this episode where they dive into a case study of an athlete Coach Ryan had the privilege of working with one-on-one. They discuss the importance of assessing your athletes/clients/patients well enough to know what the best course of action is for their needs and how that will, in the short and long term, more greatly benefit them as athletes. We sit down with Andy Larson, owner of Float Milwaukee in the Walker's Point neighborhood of Milwaukee, Wisconsin to talk about Floating. What is it? Is it good for athletic recovery, mental health, pain? How does it work? What are the benefits?
 Dr. Guillermo was lucky enough to get to experience Floating himself for the first time prior to this interview and he gives his review and talks about his experience with Andy.  Mental toughness. What is it? When is it necessary? Is it necessary? How does a coach combine their own philosophies/methodology with the overlying philosophies of the CrossFit methodology when he/she programs for a gym that has a variety of members with a variety of goals?

Even though I would know all the answers in class when I was asked, when it came to my homework, I was just not able to communicate it well. One of my teachers said that my work was “sloppy” and I wasn’t “working hard enough”. I was so frustrated and I didn’t understand why homework was so difficult” “As my fingers slowly touched the skin on my wrist, it was like braille – each one of those bumps told a story. Every scar was a tale of pain that I wished away with every cut. And though I felt relief at that time, I soon realized, it wasn’t going to solve my problems.” I dreaded waking up. Sleep was difficult for me, as I couldn’t stop thinking. I was exhausted and yet, my mind was racing. I could barely open my eyes and my body resisted movement of any kind. I couldn’t stay in bed, though I wish I could shut the world out completely. Waking up meant that I had to face everything; everyone, and that scared me “I’m used to it now. I don’t mind talking about it because people just want to know what it’s like, but other times, I get so offended by these questions that I just walk away. When it all started, that time at the concert all those years ago, I had no idea my life was about to go through a convoluted course that took me from raging frenzies to deplorable pits” The Mpower movement strives to stamp out the stigma associated with mental health concerns.

In Episode 90 I sit down with former President of the American College of Cardiology Dr Kim Williams to discuss the role that our diet plays in the preventing, suspending and reversing cardiovascular disease. If you want to know what foods are causing your arteries to 'clog' and how to avoid this then I highly recommend listening to this exchange.  Kim is an absolute wealth of knowledge and unlike so much of what you see on social media these days, his stance is based on the totality of evidence - not anecdotes and not theories but hard evidence from all different levels of scientific investigation.

The simple fact is that many of us see heart attacks and strokes as 'inevitable' and a 'normal' part of getting old but this couldn't be further from the truth. Many populations who choose to eat differently to us are significantly less likely to develop cardiovascular disease. And it's not just observational science that points to a plant exclusive or predominant diet as the ultimate way to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, with several controlled trials reaching the same conclusion. Some of which we talk about in this episode.

Born and trained in Chicago, Dr Williams was a professional level tennis player and coach before choosing rather to pursue a career in cardiology. Since 2013, he has headed up the cardiology department of Rush University Medical Center - where many of his colleagues have also found their way to adopting a plant-based diet.

Dr Williams has served on numerous committees and boards at the United States national level, including - but certainly not limited to - the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the American Medical Association. Among other presidencies throughout his distinguished career, Dr Williams was the 2016 President of American College of Cardiology.

Kim is the inaugural Editor in Chief of the International Journal of Disease Reversal and Prevention (IJDRP). This new journal has been created to document the science of nutrition and lifestyle to prevent, suspend and reverse disease.

Kim is also on the 'International ​Advisory Council​' for Doctors For Nutrition - a wonderful Australian organisation dedicated to helping equip healthcare practitioners, institutions and the public with evidence-based information and education on optimum human nutrition. As mentioned during this episode if you are from Adelaide or can get to Adelaide on Feb 2nd 2020 to listen to Dr Kim Williams, along with a host of other speakers, at the Doctors for Nutrition Symposium I highly recommend it - you can get tickets here.

Specifically we cover: 

 • The prevalence of cardiovascular disease
 • Kim's path to Medicine
 • Nutrition training during Medical School
 • Being elected President of the American College of Cardiology
 • The difference between the ACC/AHA guidelines and the USDA dietary guidelines
 • The role of industry in effecting guidelines
 • How he explains to patients the importance of changing their diet
 • What dietary components increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis (narrowing of the artery with plaque build up)
 • Why LDL cholesterol is an independent risk factor
 • What a heart healthy diet looks like
 • Changes he would like to see in the 2020 USDA dietary guidelines 
 • Government policy changes he would like to see
 • The types of foods he likes to eat in his own diet
 • and much much more

RESOURCES:

1 - Jupiter study - we spoke about this when discussing LDL cholesterol and inflammation
2 - A second study to look at on LDL cholesterol as an independent risk factor
3 - The ACC/AHA 2019 guidelines - The Predimed Trial we spoke about is discussed within these guidelines. Pay special attention to the PRO-Vegetarian aspect of that paragraph.  Essentially, those within the Mediterranean Diet group who ate les In Episode 89 I sit down with a long time friend of mine, Sean Ryan. Sean and I recently caught up for dinner and he expressed interest in changing his lifestyle. Particularly given that cardiovascular disease runs in his family and he is ticking quite a few of the boxes when it comes to modifiable risk factors for having a heart attack or stroke.

In fact lifestyle changes are something that Sean has been embarking on for the better part of a year with mixed results. He cannot help but feel confused by all of the mixed messages that that exist across the internet and among health professionals in his community and in many respects has been left feeling disempowered and unsure what to do. As Sean and I got talking during our dinner I realised how valid his questions were and suggested we shared our conversations, and his journey to better health, as a series on this show to hopefully inspire others. He generously agreed and here we are - the first of a handful of episodes with Sean.

In this episode we cover:

1 - Why Sean wants to change his lifestyle
2 - We hear bit's and pieces about Sean's past and life growing up
3 - Why he is confused about what to eat
4 - Why some of the things I say are evidence based are different to what the Heart Association recommend
5 - Answers to questions he has about a plant-based diet
6 - A plan from here

Over the course of the next few months I will upload follow up conversations with Sean where we check back in, get an update, go through any questions he has and make plans for the next period. In the next episode we will be discussing his baseline blood tests, his first grocery experience, how he is feeling physically and mentally, what it's been like creating meals without animal products and of course any new questions that he has.

Slightly different format that I hope you enjoy. If you do, please share the episode on social media (I know Sean would love your support) and leave a review on the Apple Podcast app. Either or both would be greatly appreciated!

Happy listening friends,

Book coming out 2020 published with Penguin that I cannot wait to share with you (all proceeds being donated to charity) In Episode 88 I sit down with Seb Alex to talk about the importance of animal welfare and what life looks like through the lens of an Animal Activist.

Specifically we cover:

 • Normalising veganism
 • The impossible burger: Does he eat it and what does he think about their practices?
 • Things to consider when supporting large chains like Hungry Jacks who have added vegan burgers onto their menu
 • What is a vegan?
 • What is a sentient being?
 • Different levels of sentience
 • Are oysters sentient beings?
 • What is speciesism?
 • Growing up in Lebanon and his transition to a vegetarian diet and then ultimately a vegan diet
 • Is veganism extreme?
 • Developing the courage to be an activist
 • The notion of 'humane' slaughter - does it exist?
 • Ag-Gag laws protecting the animal agriculture industry
 • and much much more

I completely understand this episode and the topic of animal welfare is often a little uncomfortable (I totally get it) and perhaps you have a stereotypical view of an animal activist being angry, weird and violent. I know I used to. Today's guest, Animal Activist Seb Alex, is anything but that and I urge all of you, vegan or not, to listen to this conversation with an open mind. Even if you're not interested in veganism it's interesting to listen to what people from different walks of lives have to say...how they see the world. 10 years ago if I came across this podcast - I would probably keep scrolling. In fact I definitely would of. I often think about my early University days and why I never stopped to think about eating animal products. I grew up loving dogs and farm animals...but I never once fully appreciated the connection between my food plate with an animals life and how my consumption affected their happiness. The odd thing is I look back on myself a decade ago and I see the same person...the values and beliefs were there but I was closed. I was not in a place to allow new ideas to challenge the way I had been programmed.

Now that I understand the power of opening your mind I have discussions with people all the time who see things differently to me not just about nutrition but all things in life. I can escape the echo chamber that we so often comfortably find ourselves in. A place where there is the natural tendency to only surround yourself with people who share your thoughts. I always walk away from these conversations. Happy that they give me the opportunity to challenge my beliefs and think a little deeper. Happy they gave me an opportunity to learn something new. It's these types of conversations that allow our minds to expand. You may find todays message resonates with you. You may find it takes you to places in your mind that you have never visited. You may find it doesn't. The point is, you will be better informed with regards to how an animal activist sees the world, you will better understand their perspective and then with that you can do what you want! If this isnt an episode for you right now -thats completely fine, jump over to any number of previous episodes on nutrition and come back to this one when it feels right.

Plant Yourself - Embracing a Plant-based Lifestyle,"The Plant Yourself Podcast features interviews with guests who are healing the world in various ways. From plant-based nutrition, to joyful movement, to evidence-based healthcare, to gardening, to environmental action, to social justice, to spiritual common sense - basically, all the folks I want to be friends with.Listen to a few episodes, subscribe if you like, and meet my friends. Michael Greger's latest book, How Not to Diet, is just stunning.

It's a love song to science: its potential, its process, even its limitations.

There has never been a more comprehensive, accessible, and evidence-based look at our current knowledge of how to get to and maintain a healthy weight.

With almost 5000 citations, all easily clickable from the NutritionFacts.org website, there's none of the smoke and mirrors, intentional obfuscation, or sloppy interpretation that plagues most diet books.

In fact, Greger writes in the preface: “Here's the problem: I hate diet books. Furthermore, I hate diet books that purport to hate diet books, yet relish in all the same absurdities. This book is for those who want facts, not filler, fantasy, or fluff.”

I assumed – and Greger confirmed that he also assumed – that the book would be a comprehensive review of the literature that basically would tell me what I already know: that a whole foods, plant-based diet is the best way to eat, not only for health, but for svelth. (Not a word, but should be!)



And the book did not disappoint; it clearly shows that high-fiber, plant-based diets lead to normalized body mass through a wide variety of mechanisms:



* the ileal brake and the fiber feedback loop

* caloric density

* down-regulation of fat-metabolizing enzymes

* glycemic index

* reduction in hyper-palatability triggers

* and many more…



What I didn't expect to discover were a laundry list of, for lack of a better word, hacks that have been shown in rigorous scientific tests to support weight loss:



* when we eat

* when we exercise

* common spices

* the angle of our beds

* small amounts of vinegar at every meal

* eating and sipping slowly

* aggressive use of the bathroom scale

* and lots more…



We spoke for 29 minutes and 44 seconds about the book, about the future of research, and how each of us can take control of our weight in a world that drives us to over-consume.

Music

The Plant Yourself Podcast theme music, “Dance of Peace (Sabali Don),” is generously provided by Will Ridenour, Matt Buckner's low point came one day about 9 years ago, when he was 41. He was getting ready for an international business trip, and realized that one of his key medications, tramadol, was going to run out during the trip.The drug, which Matt took for the back pain caused by his morbid obesity, was one of five meds that he consumed every day. The others were for hypertension, high cholesterol, acid reflux, and depression.Matt also suffered from sleep apnea; his wife would force herself to stay awake at night so she could hear when he stopped breathing and wake him up.While waiting on line at the drug store, without an up-to-date prescription since he couldn't get in touch with his doctor on short notice on a Friday afternoon, Matt looked around and saw the other people in line. All of them old and sick. There's where he was headed.Matt took action.

					He started with keto and extreme caloric restriction, which helped him lose 50 pounds in a single month. But it was unsustainable, and he was not a nice, happy person during that time. He would deprive himself of food and work out hard at the gym as punishment, as expressions of self-loathing.Eventually, he discovered Forks Over Knives on Netflix, and the suggested next movie was Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead. While eating a whole-food plant-based diet made some sense to Matt, it was the extreme deprivation and maniacal focus required by consuming nothing but vegetable juice that really appealed to his inner masochist.The next set of influences, including Rich Roll, Josh LaJaunie, and Rip Esselstyn, gradually shifted Matt away from his carbophobia, and into a lifestyle that was predicated on self-love rather than self-loathing. And one that was sustainable from both physiological and psychological standpoints.Here's Matt meeting Josh for their first run together:

				

				

				

				

					

																					

				

				

				

				

					Matt is now one of the unofficial running coaches for members of the super-secret “Missing Chins Run Club,” and has been a huge help and inspiration to many others who want to shift to a healthy, active lifestyle.Matt's hope for this podcast – and his public advocacy in general – is to inspire people to realize, “Hey, if that guy can do it, then so can I!”As he approaches his 50th birthday, he's looking forward to more wild adventures, Myq Kaplan is a stand-up comedian who also happens to be vegan (or is it the other way around?)

He's performed on the Tonight Show, Conan, the Late Show with David Letterman, Late Night with Seth Meyers, the Late Late Show with James Corden, in his own half-hour Comedy Central Presents special, and in his own one-hour special on Netflix and Amazon, Small, Dork, and Handsome.

I was introduced to Myq's cerebral brand of comedy by my daughter, who has memorized his entire published body of work word for word, so I don't need him anymore (sorry, Myq).

In case you're wondering about the centrality of veganism to his life and work, his first album, which was one of iTunes top 10 comedy albums of the year in 2010, is called “Vegan Mind Meld.”

He also contributed an essay to The Reducetarian Solution (edited by another Plant Yourself guest, Brian Kateman), in which he points out that eating a vegan meal and thinking that you're deprived is really focusing on all the things that aren't on the plate. And that no matter what you eat, there are lots of things not on your plate. So chill.

Myq and I talked about the theory of comedy (he uses big words like “benign violation” and “theory”), and how being funny can help people shift their perspectives on serious issues.



Myq uses language in very thoughtful ways; for example, he pointed out the difference between asking someone “Do you eat chicken?” and “Do you eat chickens?”

I asked about the cliche that comedians had troubled childhoods, and we talked about that fact that maybe plumbers also have troubled childhoods but their job is to fix leaks rather than talk about their childhoods, so we don't notice quite as much. And I didn't even make a pun about comedians' (wise)cracks.

We also explored how the comedic method – which often starts with looking for what's strange, weird, annoying, or crazy in a situation – contributed to his veganism and allows him to talk about it in non-threatening ways.

And we spent a fair bit of time chewing on his spiritual interests and practices, and how spending time on self-development can help us escape from the “Infinite Mirror of Assholes” that we can live within.

As co-founder and CEO of FloWater, which aims to reduce and ultimately end our dependence on single-use plastic water bottles, Raz has become an impassioned advocate for public health and environmental sanity.

His message: bottled water is the new cigarette. As in,  it's killing us.

Huh? How is that possible?

Turns out that the billions of plastic bottles we consume every year don't biodegrade; they “photo-degrade” in our landfills and oceans, and the tiny microparticles of plastic end up in our water, our food, and ourselves.

The irony is, bottled water became popular because of fears of polluted tap water. But the bottles themselves end up polluting our tap water, in ways that antiquated municipal filtration systems can't handle.

Just like second-hand smoke harms non-smokers, second-hand plastic in our environment affects everyone, not just those who drink out of disposable plastic bottles.

And it disproportionately impacts the poor and vulnerable (think Flint, Michigan, and many other lesser-known places) who can't afford personal filtration at their homes.

In our conversation, Rich lays out the problem and offers suggestions for how as individuals and society we can reverse this alarming trend.

Music Jim Loomis, MD is Medical Director of the Barnard Medical Center, and one of the stars of the blockbuster documentary The Game Changers.

Dr Loomis' journey to plant-based practice for himself and his patients began with a viewing of Forks Over Knives, at a time when his own health was starting to fail.

Once he discovered and benefited personally from Lifestyle Medicine, he began to see that the paradigm of human health he had been taught was seriously flawed.

He summed it up this way: “If I'm not sick, then I must be well.”

This kind of thinking keeps medicine on the defensive, dealing with health problems that never needed to manifest in the first place. And in addition to the untold suffering brought about by all this unnecessary disease, disability, and premature death, the medical system is strangling the US economy. Of the $3.5 trillion spent on health care annually, Dr Loomis pointed out, roughly 80% is entirely preventable through simple and cheap lifestyle interventions.

Diabetes, for example. Dr Loomis points out that while diabetes is viewed by modern medicine as a chronic disease, it's actually nothing more than a normal physiological response to abnormal patterns of eating.



Fun facts about Dr Loomis: he was the team doctor for the St Louis Rams (football) and the St Louis Cardinals (baseball), as well as the tour physician for the St Louis Symphony Orchestra, which I believe went undefeated during his tenure there.

He's an avid triathlete, having competed most recently in the Lake Placid Ironman in 2019 (at the age of 60).

As a medical spokesperson for The Game Changers, Dr Loomis loves to point out that there isn't a special “athlete diet” – we're all athletes, and we all need to eat to fuel our bodies for peak performance.

He's not only fun and personable and a living example of the power of lifestyle, but he speaks with a command of the facts and a common sense perspective that makes him an ideal mouthpiece for the movement.

In June, 2019, Dr Milton Mills gave testimony before the USDA Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee about their persistent recommendation to include dairy in our diets.

Dr Mills short presentation was not what I was expecting to hear.

Instead of just repeating the overwhelming body of evidence showing that cow's milk is not a healthy or suitable food for humans,  he put the debate in the context of racism.

He said, “I actually came here today to call out the racism that is inherent in the US dietary guidelines, but then as I got a look at this committee, I suddenly understood why it's such an intractable problem. This committee bears no relationship to the general American populace, and whoever put it together is clearly still practicing the optics of tokenism.”

After that, Dr Mills shared the evidence. He noted that that most non-whites lack the genetic variation that allows them to digest lactose. He pointed out that mandating the inclusion of milk in school lunches systemically harms people of color. And since African American women tend to be less prone to osteoporosis, insisting that this population consume dairy for calcium makes twice as little sense.

A couple of his zingers:

“We have no more reason to suck on the teats of a cow than we do to suck on the breasts of a post-partum weasel.”

“Drinking dairy for its nutrient content is equivalent to inhaling cigarette smoke for its oxygen content.”

Watch Dr Mills' 3-minute presentation here:



At a vegan conference in September, I ran into a plant-based policy advocate (white) whom I've known for a while. I mentioned Dr Mills performance with admiration, and she quickly cut me off: “He did no favors to the movement with his anger.”

I was too shocked to speak, so I let the moment slip away as she headed off down the escalator.

But it stayed with me.

When we deny anger to those who have been oppressed, in the interest of “effective communication” and “civility,” we're doing more than being strategic. We're invalidating their suffering, and we're actually propping up the status quo.

After all, it's very easy for society to oppress people in a civil and polite way.

While racism is obviously a problem “out there,” the question I had to ask myself was, “Is it a problem ‘in here'?” Because I hadn't registered that the entire nutritional guidelines panel was white – as I looked upon their faces, I didn't think, “That's odd – where are the people of color?” It just looked “normal” to me.

Until Dr Mills called it out.

And I'm not the only one in the plant-based community who has been blind to my own internalized racism. Dr Mills deals with this all the time in conversations at vegfests and conferences.

As he insisted during our conversation for this podcast, “I'm not a magic Negro.”

Meaning, he has no responsibility to suppress his anger, Jackie Robinson-style, to make sure my feelings aren't hurt and that I don't feel any discomfort.

In August, Dr Mills and Josh LaJaunie came to North Carolina for the Triangle Vegfest. The organizer, Helene Ann Greenberg, asked Dr Mills to speak about racism in the vegan community, along with vegan trainer Korin Sutton. Dr Mills asked me and Josh to join the panel as well, probably to help bridge the gap between his experience and that of the white folks in the audience.

Here's a hastily-shot video of that panel discussion:

Power and Strength Radio,"This podcast is devoted to helping others become the strongest most powerful versions of themselves. Through powerful and engaging conversations and insights on topics related to Physical, Spiritual, Relational and Mental/Emotional Strength, we strive to help people ""build their bounce"" (resiliency) and connect to the ""extra""-ordinary in themselves so that they can lend that strength the those around them and encourage others to do the same. In this episode of Power and Strength Radio, we sit down with Christian Sticker.  Christian is a strength and conditioning coach and a Crossfit coach at Oregon Crossfit in Bend Oregon.  During this conversation we dive into why Christian trains himself and his clients for maximizing physical strength as well as some the unique methods that he utilizes to accomplish the task.  Some other unique insights that came out of our time together:


 Recognizing his own weaknesses from a strength standpoint
 Going from small kid to formidable athlete because of strength training

Youtube- Ethos of Strength On this episode of Power and Strength Radio, I had the honor of sitting down with long time friend, mentor and colleague Curtis Tucker.  Curtis is the Lead Teaching Pastor of Redmond Community Church in Redmond Oregon where he has served in that role for over 20 years.  In addition to being a pastor, Curtis is also an author, husband, father and business owner.  During our conversation we dive into some of the insights that Curtis has learned being in the professional ministry for 30 years and how that is shaping and has shaped how he sees and engages in relationships. Some of the things that came out of this amazing conversation:


 Embracing change as a part of personal growth
 How one of the critical aspects of personal growth lies in self-awareness
  How Spiritual certainty is often a log jam to growth
  How understanding a person's back story and seeing the big picture is key in relationships
  How to manage criticism 
  How hardship is a good teacher
  ....and so many more

 Our biggest Joys of the last 20 years
 Defining the WIN for your marriage
 The biggest surprise
 How to enter into conflict well
  Why knowing who you are is critical to your marriage
  Why dating is important
  ...Plus so much More.

This is the conversation we would have wanted to have starting out our own marriage.

BreakThrough Strength and Performance This is an impromptu episode.  The original concept is from Bishop (Pastor) TD Jakes.  It is on identifying the 3 people in our lives.  Identifying the 3 people in our lives and relating powerfully is directly related to how we see our Identity vs. our Roles.

The 3 People in our Lives:

Confidantes

Constituents

Comrades.

Each plays a very different role (not good or bad, just different), but how we see ourselves, can truly change the interaction.  In this episode we explore why knowing who you are (identity) is critical and why believing your role (what you do) is who you are, can really impact your relationships as well as mental and emotional strength.

YouTube:  Ethos of Strength In this episode of the Courage Corner we mine some of the nuggets out of our conversation with Levi Markwardt (episode 5).  While this conversation was chalked full of wisdom and insight, we are going to dial in on 3 that we can utilize to build some ""bounce"" physically, Spiritually, and relational.  The 3 actionable steps from this episode:


  Find a coach and or a mentor
 Take a :30 to :90 second cold shower / Perform 3, 5 or 10 burpees Every Minute on the Minute for 30 Minutes (depending on conditioning)
  For the next 30 days, write down at least 1 thing that you are grateful for each day

Building your Bounce or resiliency is a skill.  And Skill takes practice.

www.ethosofstrength.com - Coming Soon On today's episode of Power and Strength Radio, I had the pleasure to visit with someone that I have been a fan of for sometime and engage in some limited conversations over the last few years, Levi Markwardt.  Levi is a strength coach and a competitor in Kettlebell Sport in the half marathon snatch event.  Last year he competed along with Team USA in Spain along with his two daughters.  In a world where everything online says ""just give us your best"", Levi gets raw and real in this conversation about being a business owner, a coach, an athlete, but also a man being a husband and a dad.  We discuss Levi's training philosophy called ""harder to kill training"" and how that ties into mental toughness as well as the parallels he has found training like this with his strong faith.  We really get into some strong talk during this episode, and I feel that we will all leave this conversation empowered and inspired to live real, vulnerable and strong versions of ourselves, not as copies of anyone else.

Some of what we get into during this conversation:


 What Levi would eat if it were his last meal (this was a fun question)
 What his training has taught him about enduring in life
  How he handles disappointment
  Losing his dad and how that impacted him to take control of his life
  Training with and competing with his daughters on a world stage
  Being present with His family and being a Man who follows through
  What he is reading and why
  On having a coach himself
  Being real and authentic and not falling into the comparison trap
  .....So many more Wisdom nuggets

I'm in awe of the Kansas City Chiefs and all the incredible life lessons they keep throwing our way! As I watched the AFC Championship game, and the post-game interviews, I took notes because there was so much goodness, and I knew I needed to share my observations. We can learn a lot from the Chiefs, and in this episode, I'm sharing seven life lessons I picked up on over the last 48 hours.  The Kansas City Chiefs were down 24-0 in the first 20 minutes of the game last weekend. Everyone thought they were doomed. Quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, kept his cool, remained calm, and gave a speech to his team. ""Let's do something special,"" he said.

What can we learn from the speech that spurred the comeback? In this episode, I share four thoughts from Mahomes' speech that we can all apply to get the outcomes we want at work, in sports, and in life. Today on the podcast, I want to help you do a little dreaming, which I think is critical if you want to achieve big things. If you have some extra time throughout this holiday week, I encourage you to take some time to relax and daydream... and maybe even create your own vision board. I always do a “what’s your word” post or podcast at the end of the year—all about choosing a phrase or word to focus on for the new year. And, this year is no different. But I want to put a little different spin on the exercise this year. Because New Year’s Resolutions are BOGUS. I am excited to talk to you today about five health and fitness trends that I think will be hot in the new decade. After you listen, I'd love to hear what trends you think will be big in the coming years. Be sure to connect with me on social media! I was honored to have Dr. Mark Cucuzzella for this episode. We covered a bunch of topics, including nutrition for runners, low carb vs high/moderate carb, how focusing on nutrition first can help those who are more sedentary feel like exercising, and the Nike Vaporfly controversy. "

Primal Armor,"Primal Armor’s philosophy is to go back to the basics to focus on health and wellness. Physical health is based on scientific research and the fundamental ways our bodies as humans function. Emotional health and Mental health are highlighted because they lay the building blocks for better physical health. You cannot have superb physical health if you’re struggling mental or emotional. Lastly, spiritual health is significantly focused upon in this podcast. A relationship with God is the building block for every other thing you will experience in life. It is time to step up and make the changes. This week I challenge us to improve our health above the standard in which we are at as a society. We are an overweight, unhealthy society that doesn’t put nutrition and exercise as a priority. It’s time we make it our priority. In this episode, I cover how to keep motivation and consistency towards a healthy lifestyle when life gets tough. Whether that’s simple daily stressors, or life changing events, I cover how to change your mindset and work through anything life can throw your way. In this weeks episode, we cover what it takes to make the first steps toward eating healthier and leaving our unhealthy eating habits in the past. This week we talk more about getting back to the basics of our human ways and taking the little steps to becoming more active each and every day. Quick little podcast about what Primal Armor is, and where it is headed in the future."
Primal Edge Health,"Welcome to the Primal Edge Health podcast hosted by Tristan Haggard, founder of Primal Edge Health. Explore cutting edge holistic lifestyle optimization with a focus on nutrition, environment, light, movement, and worldview. We use animal-based nutrition, the ketogenic diet, the carnivore diet, whole unrefined ancestral foods, regenerative agriculture, homesteading, and a holistic lifestyle approach for health, vitality, and optimal performance so we can thrive and bring others along for the ride. Build healthy bodies, homes, families, and communities together, because we are far more than what we eat.Hosted By: Tristan HaggardEmail: Tristan@primaledgehealth.com www.primaledgehealth.com Jon Venus, vegan fitness e-celeb, says he ate some eggs for a couple of days, so you don’t have to. RIP those poor eggs. Will he be tried for murduhr? Is Jon still vegan? Was he never really vegan? Jon Venus comes on for a chat with Tristan and Bobby’s Perspective, an outspoken former vegan who left the movement last year and is using a carnivore / keto approach to recover his health, which he says was ravaged by veganism. Vegan or Carnivore, which diet is the real game-changer for health and performance? Dr. Leo  Venus advocates a plant-based diet, Dr. Shawn Baker has eaten an all-meat diet for over 2 years. Who wins? PETA caught making deepfake videos, staging incidents, and doing all sorts of fookery. What's the real agenda behind PETA and ""animal rights""?

Dr. Joel Kahn has had a hard year...help him get his future back from the big mean grown-ups like Joe Rogan who refuse to go vegan. Fake steaks are the ""holy grail "" of fake meat made by industrial vegan kibble producers who tell us it's not ""natural"" or healthy to eat meat. This is beyond dumb.

David Attenborough and Netflix tell noble lies to get their future back and save the planet. Review of the plant-based #vegan documentary The Game Changers, produced by James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Should we all go #plantbased? Is #carnivore now debunked?  The legendary Dr. Greger shows his genius once again with a super hard vegan parlor trick. Dr. Neal Barnard makes a fool of himself with the politely skeptical host of London Real with absurd claims and nonsensical vegan rhetoric that expose his lack of sincerity. Kai Greene, top bodybuilder and huge fan of grapefruit, sells the plant-based dream."
Primal Wisdom,"Bliss River's Primal Wisdom Podcast is dedicated to the complete healing of the individual on all levels: physical, mental, emotional and spiritual.

Thanks for listening! In this episode Corey Taylor owner of Corey Taylor Sports Performance or PTSP in Louisville Kentucky talks about his journey and about his background from playing in the NFL to training on the PGA Tour to the very unique facility that he owns today. 

Corey really dives into the importance of understanding the culture that you are trying to create or the people you are trying to connect with.  

Corey hits on a lot of things involving trainer's and client's mindset:
Many trainers fail because they are simply not willing to put in the work or aren't willing to go through the grind.

Tips for success: Always be learning, push to learn something new every single day and at the end of the day be sure to do it your way.

Pumpen Poppen Pizza,"Der Podcast, bei dem der Name Programm ist! In jeder Folge sprechen wir über Pumpen, Poppen und Pizza. Natürlich nicht über Pizza direkt, Pizza steht für den großen Kosmos der Ernährung und alles rund um einen gesunden Lebensstil. Ich denke Pumpen und Poppen sind relativ selbst erklärend (Zwinker).Dieser Podcast ist für alle - es gibt keine Tabus! Egal ob leidenschaftlicher Pumper, romantischer Liebhaber oder Schoki-Junkie. In diesem Podcast wird jeder unterhalten UND ich verspreche, dass ihr dabei sogar etwas lernen werdet. Wir widmen uns verschiedenen Trainingsmethoden, wie man das Mysterium Frau (oder Mann) versteht und wie ihr es schafft, ein Sixpack zu bekommen, trotz leckerem Eis am Abend.Neben Geschichten von persönlichen Erfahrungen, lebt dieser Podcast auch von dir! Du hast etwas lustiges zu erzählen, brauchst Rat oder möchtest einfach deine Geschichte teilen? Dann schreib mir auf ask.fm oder Instagram. Anonymität garantiert! Es gibt geileres als kalt zu duschen, aber die kalte dusche am Morgen kann nicht nur für mehr Muskeln sorgen und beim Abnehmen helfen, sondern auch für eine bessere Performance im Bett garantieren!

Pumpen: Muskelaufbau durch Atemkontrolle und Körperwahrnehmung. Die kalte dusche zeigt dir den Weg!

Poppen: Länger im Bett durchhalten. Gewusst wie!

Pizza: Mythos kalt duschen und abnehmen? Was ist dran? Pumpen: Wie steige ich nach einer Trainingspause wieder effizient ins Training ein?

Poppen: Erstes Date? Was nun? Meine Tipps für ein perfektes erstes Date!

Pizza: Du willst deine Ernährung ändern, weißt aber nicht wie du starten sollst? Also quasi dein ""erstes Date"" mit deiner neuen Ernährungsform? Ich verrate dir, wie du langfristig am Ball bleibst...

Wenn du Fragen hast, Bock auf geilen Fitnesscontent oder Lust auf ein Personal Training hast - check mein Instagram aus und schreib mir eine Nachricht! Wie sehr setzen wir uns selbst unter Druck? Gefallen wir uns selbst?

Selbstakzeptanz ist ein Pfad, vielleicht das höchste Gut eines Menschen, etwas, das er über Jahre versucht zu erlernen, vielleicht nie erlernt. Daran werden keine Muskeln etwas ändern - oder doch? Welche Rolle spielt Social Media dabei? 

Pumpen: welchen Einfluss hat Instagram auf unser persönliches Schönheitsideal?

Poppen: Pornos und Schönheitswahn?

Ernährung: Beeinflusst Instagram unser Essverhalten?
Special: Dürfen Männer sich schminken? Ihr wolltet schon immer Mäuschen in einer Mädelsrunde spielen? 

3 Girls plaudern aus dem Nähkästchen - 1 Stunde ohne Tabus - über Blowjobs, den perfekten Penis, Blümchensex, Fesseln und was sie am meisten anturnt. 

Sex ist schon lange kein Tabu-Thema mehr: Unterhaltung garantiert! Spezialfolge!

Jetzt wird es versaut. Ihr habt entschieden und auf Instagram abgestimmt. Da habt ihr es. Ohne Blatt vor dem Mund und vor allem, nicht ALLEIN... Neues Jahr, neue Entscheidungen - raus aus der Komfortzone, aber wie?

Heute gebe ich dir ein Handbuch mit, wie du Alltagsentscheidungen besser und effizienter entscheiden kannst.

Intro: Was sind Ängste? Warum haben wir Angst vor Veränderungen? Welche Methoden helfen...

Pumpen: Sei mutig, trau dir auch etwas zu! Probier dich aus und lerne deinen Körper neu kennen.

Poppen: Ansprechen, offene Kommunikation und Transparenz bedarf Mut. Raus aus der Komfortzone, spreche offen über deine Gefühle und Empfindungen.

Pizza: Du bist verantwortlich für neue Entscheidungen, hab keine Angst, probier dich aus - Essen macht Spaß!"

Purpose Through Fitness with Kevin Fedish,"My name is Kevin Fedish, and I believe that my true purpose in life is to spread love, positivity and fitness with the world. One of the ways I believe we can ALL find our purpose is through physical and mental fitness.  Without some form of mental and physical conditioning, success is near impossible.  I'm honored and blessed to share my story and my journey with you and bring in some guests along the way.  New Episodes weekly.  Listen on all major podcast platforms, and please rate and review if you enjoy this podcast. In the world today, we are surrounded by so much negativity that we are seeing the effects on an entire generation of children.  We need positivity now more than ever and I believe this is where God and Religion collide.  Our thoughts and emotions can actually shape the world and reality around us. Sure we breath everyday, but did you know breathing is one of the few ways that the body naturally detoxifies itself?  Through rhythmic breathing, there are NUMEROUS health benefits for the body, mind and spirit.  Join me as we discuss in detail these benefits and check out my YouTube video on proper deep breathing techniques.

https://youtu.be/mj9yndMeQFg Society today has taught us to avoid failure at all costs.  Even our brains are wired to avoid pain and take the ""easier"" path.  This episode discusses exactly what Failure is, why you MUST fail in order to succeed.  I am a firm believer that if you learn from your failures and never quit, then you can never lose! Back after a long hiatus and ready to tackle 2020 with everything I have.  We are going to share a journey together and help one another unlock and find our true potential in life.
What goals do you have? What are you most afraid of? We all know that exercise is healthy for our body, but did you know all the mental and spiritual benefits of exercise?  Tune in as we discuss some of the lesser known benefits to exercise and why it is so important for EVERYONE to get out and move. This episode focuses on The Spotlight Effect and why we tend to believe people think about and judge us FAR more than they really do.  Join me as we discuss why this is the case, and how you can begin to overcome this fear."

And I am all about faith and fitness here on my show and on all the work that I've been doing with BeFit4Akhirah. So having Sara come on the show to talk about faith and fitness from the Jewish perspective was super inspirational.
The mission of Fit Jewess is the following:
Fit Jewess has a two-fold mission:
1. To provide women and gals across the world with tips, guidance, and inspirationto help cross the divide between our fitness goals and current lifestyles from a bodypositive, weight-neutral perspective.
In other words, to prove to matzah balls and potato latkes that we can and will befit despite our culture-specific idiosyncrasies.
2. To serve as a community of like-minded Fit Jewesses that supports, encouragesand cheers on one another.
After all, only we truly know what it’s like to be fit, female and Jewish.
On today's episode, we talked about the following:
The traditions of Hanukkah.
How faith played a role in our lifestyle and in getting active even more.
The body image movement that Sara is on and how it's related to what I am going to be launching in 2020.
And of course, so much more!

Family relationships are filled with ups and downs. Many people would put their own families in the “complicated” category. Parents are supposed to be the most significant role models in our lives, show us the right way, teach us to do the most necessary functions to live a prosperous life, and above all, show us, love.
 What happens when that dynamic goes wrong, and love is unable to be given by the person whom we need it the most?

Overall race was near ideal. From weather, to race day conditions and to the overall results of the finish. Everything was executed to near perfection from nutrition to race day strategy. A few lessons learnt for the bike to take of in the future. Bummed to missed the mark of going under sub 5hour by 29SECONDS. Wished someone told him on the course to pick up the pace a bit to get under sub 5.

Instagram:  @PerfectRacePodcast Mental grit and determination are a normal to see on race day.  However, the level of perseverance through pain that Joe displays during the race at Louisville is quite astonishing. He went into this race prepared, but also injured.  We discuss what happened as well as what has changed with his nutrition.  A big change has happened since he came on last year to talk about his race in Texas.  While you listen to the episode, I’d encourage you to make a note on how he uses nutrition on race day.  Thank you Joe for coming back on the show.

Instagram:  @PerfectRacePodcast Was a very interesting race for me. With the swim being cancelled I was pretty bummed because it gives me an overall advantage over a lot of the fast bikers and runners. My biggest focus going into this race was not to over bike. I made mistakes at IMWI and I didn't want to repeat. I biked controlled and consistent. Had a few low spots on the bike and run, but managed to pop off a PR bike and PR run in the IRONMAN distance and take the overall win by 2.5 mins.

Following on from their weight-loss strategy in Episode 3, Pete and Charlie now dive into setting up a successful weight-gaining phase, or as it's so commonly labelled, a 'bulk'. Bulking season certainly allows for extra flexibility with your nutrition, but in your order to optimise your health and performance, in should be pursued in a methodical manner. In Episode #4 Pete &amp; Charlie are joined on the Podcast by Jay Foster who next year will be looking to complete the 5 Peak Challenge made by himself. Starting in the Republic of Ireland Jay will be climbing Carrauntoohil then running to Northern Ireland and climbing Slieve Donard. Then swimming from Northern Ireland across to Scotland which will take approximately 18 hours. Then run from where he lands in Scotland up to Ben Nevis climbing that mountain. With the small challenge remaining to run to Scafell Pike climb it, run on down to Snowdon and finish at the peak of Snowdon. Absolute insanity and will take some real work to complete all in aid of CALM. In this episode Pete and Charlie dive into the fundamentals of dieting for weight loss and what it takes to succeed. In episode 2 Pete and Charlie are joined by IFBB Pro and owner of Peak Physique, Kelvin Hinde. They dive deep into Kelvins past and gain an insight into his journey to fulfilling his dream of becoming a professional bodybuilder. 

They talk training, nutrition, mindset and what the future holds for Kelvin now he holds that pro card. The first episode of the QN Podcast hosted by Pete and Charlie. They talk about the birth of QN, what influences them and answer some questions from instagram."

Quatrode15,"Esse espaço é dedicado a todos os profissionais da saúde e consumidores desse serviço que eu gosto de chamar de o verdadeiro plano de saúde. O podcast Quatrode15 se propõe a compartilhar informações sobre saúde e treinamento com bases científicas. Nossa proposta é deixar esse conteúdo com uma linguagem simples para que você tenha mais uma opção de entretenimento e informação nos seus treinos, no seu carro, na sua viagem de ônibus e para onde você quiser nos levar. Olá pessoas! Vamos começar o ano e abrir nossa 7ª temporada com um podcast recheado de surpresas especiais! Nessa edição 2019 do UBC temos convidados especiais, promoção de livro e o que não poderia faltar: muitas bizarrices proferidas na nossa área que você nunca imaginaria!







Como nas edições anteriores pedimos para nossos ouvintes mandarem bizarrices que eles ouviram durante o ano de 2019 pelos nossos contatos e redes sociais. Nesse ano tivemos o ENORME apoio da Daisy Motta que nos ajudou compartilhando nossa divulgação pelo seu instagram Ciencia do Exercício.  Além disso tivemos duas contrações de peso para esse programa que nos ajudaram a decidir qual a maior besteira de 2019.

E ai, façam suas apostas e se preparem para essa competição intelectualmente violenta!







O vencedor (que você só vai ficar sabendo depois que ouvir o programa) vai levar o livro cedido a nós pelo professor Fausto Porto “Virei personal e agora?”















Clique aqui par... Olá pessoas! Hoje vou apresentar aqui para vocês um podcast um pouco diferente dos nossos padrões. Nesse episódio vamos levar vocês em uma viagem lá para o VII Congresso de Ciência do Desporto que aconteceu na UNICAMP. Na verdade, essa foi uma realização de um sonho, pois sempre tivemos vontade de trazer no podcast conteúdos de eventos científicos com áudios captados diretamente dos participantes do evento.







Para que isso fosse possível gostaria de agradecer em

especial a comissão organizadora do evento composta pelos professores Karine

Jacon Sarro, João Paulo Borin, Paula Teixeira Fernandes e o presidente Prof.

Dr. Renato Barroso por permitir que esse programa fosse viabilizado. Agradecer

também a diretoria da FEF, a reitoria da UNICAMP, á FAPESP, a CAPES e a

FAEPEX (Fundo de Apoio ao Ensino, Pesquisa e Extensão da UNICAMP) que também

foram fundamentais para que esse congresso acontecesse.







Esse episódio será dividido em três partes como o tradicional onde vou comentar um pouco sobre o evento, depois vou falar como foi a minha experiência vou tentar trazer um pouquinho do que aconteceu e a terceira parte que é a mais legal você vai ouvir direto do evento a participação os pesquisadores, alunos de graduação, mestrando, doutorandos falando sobre suas pesquisas. Nessa terceira parte o áudio tem bastante ruído de fundo pois foi captado no ginásio, eu fiz um tratamento para deixar o ruído menor, mas mesmo assim dá para ouvir perfeitamente. E é bom que se você estiver com fones de ouvido vai se sentir dentro do evento!







Quero fazer um agradecimento em especial ao professor Renato Barroso, Sarah Gomes, André Vieira (que gravou 2x pq eu não tinha ligado o microfone), Danilo dos Santos, Gabriel Oliveira, Raul Canestri, Raul Prado, Paulo Eduardo, Isabela Sestari e Rômulo Dantas Alves por se disponibilizarem a fazer as gravações.

 	Problemas de espalda con algunos movimientos de Pilates (Stuart McGill).

 	¿Qué es la autofagia AMPK/mTOR?

 	Equilibrio mTOR / AMPK. Este episodio es distinto. Me entrevista Santiago Salom de Superhábitos. Hablamos un poco de salud, pero profundizamos sobre todo en la importancia de aprender, y comento algunas ideas que me han ayudado personalmente.



Os dejo su propia explicación del episodio :)







“Quiero aprender a hacer esto, pero no tengo dinero/tiempo…”



¿Te suena familiar esta frase?



Muchas personas posponen por años y años ciertos sueños con la excusa de “no tener tiempo de aprender”.



Pero… ¿qué harías si te digo que no solo puedes aprender sobre ese tema que te interesa, sino que también puedes convertirte en un líder en tu área y generar contenido para aportar valor con tus conocimientos?



Claro, tendrías que aprender un montón de cosas y, para eso, tienes que aprender a aprender.

Darle más importancia al aprendizaje

Quizás piensas que de verdad no tienes el tiempo o recursos para aprender más sobre los temas que te interesan, o tal vez te parece que son muy técnicos o complicados de entender.



Pero lo cierto es que esto es muy posible si tienes los sistemas correctos:



 	La organización de tiempo necesaria.

 	Las herramientas adecuadas.

 	Una idea clarísima de qué es lo que tienes que buscar (y qué no).



Es por eso que decidimos entrevistar a una persona que vive de aprender más y de generar contenido de valor para su gran comunidad: Marcos Vázquez de Fitness Revolucionario.



Estas claves no solo le sirven a él para saciar su curiosidad y mejorar como profesional, sino que también le permiten aportar un valor incomparable a su comunidad.



En esta entrevista nos comparte su paso a paso para generar contenido de alto valor y credibilidad.

En este episodio charlamos con Marcos Vázquez sobre sus sistemas para aprender más, profundizar y generar contenido

Los temas que conversamos en el episodio de hoy son:



 	La perspectiva de Marcos (especialización en lo general)

 	Paso a paso para aprender (cómo absorber más información)

 	¿Aprender es un hábito? (la particular visión de Marcos)

 	Cómo respaldar tus artículos (metodología para la investigación)

 	Fuentes: ¿libros o ensayos? (o llamados papers)

 	Cuánto tiempo dedicarle a crear contenido (siendo dueño de negocio)

 	Elegir el enfoque (cuando nos interesan demasiados temas)

 	Qué hacer cuando eliges el tema a desarrollar (¿enfoque al 100% o no?)

 	Leer libros completos o no (dejar un libro a la mitad)

 	Defectos en el sistema de Marcos (también tiene sus fallas…)

 	Déficit de aprendizaje (tendencias del día de hoy)

 	La idea de que hay algo más (cuándo dejar de buscar información)

 	Perderse entre tanta información (y por dónde empezar)



Como siempre, puedes escuchar también el episodio en iVoox, Spotify o Apple Podcast. Hoy hablamos con Javier Butragueño, Doctor en Ciencias de la Actividad Física y el Deporte y especialista en la planificación de la actividad física en personas con obesidad. Algunos de los temas que tocamos:

 	¿Cuándo tiene sentido usar antidepresivos?

 The Momentous Minute with Tim Caron
 Today's Momentous Minute is with Tim Caron, the owner of Allegiate Gym and performance engineer at Momentous, the sports nutrition company on a mission to clean up the supplement industry.
 Today's question is around plant-based versus whey-based proteins and the big question is when should you use a plant-based protein versus a whey-based protein?
 Tim Caron:
 More people than you realize actually have an intolerance or an allergy towards whey protein.
 Whey is a very fast digesting protein, so when you're looking at something that quickly digests, you may potentially have some adverse reactions.
 Signs and symptoms including distended gut, some skin irritation, inflamed joints, potentially loose stools, excessive flatulence, acute nausea. These might be all indications that you're not tolerating your whey protein as well as you should.
 Now, we need to supplement something in terms of getting increased protein levels, so a plant-based protein, usually kind of a combination of rice, hemp, and pea from really high quality sources, organic, and things that actually blend to make a complete protein.
 Plant based protein might be a really good alternative that doesn't have as much digestive issues as a whey protein.

 In this week's session, I had a great question from our community member Anthony who wanted me to open up about how I train and achieve work-life balance.
 Here's the truth, life balance (or work-life balance) is a myth.
 There's no such thing. But this is actually good when you understand how it works and how it actually makes your life better.
 This was something I discovered years ago and now I'm sharing this with you.

 The Momentous Minute with Tim Caron
 Today's Momentous Minute is with Tim Caron, the owner of Allegiate Gym and performance engineer at Momentous, the sports nutrition company on a mission to clean up the supplement industry.
 Today's question is can you explain the different whey sources on the market? For example, isolate, concentrate, hydrolysate, can you explain what they mean and how they're different?
 Tim Caron:
 Isolate is a whey protein extracting out all the fat and just leaving the form of protein in terms of whey.
 Hydrolysate is basically an isolate that goes through a heating process, breaks down the peptides in to more individual amino acids and removes excess amounts of casein and sugar, specifically lactose.
 In the case of whey, they bio-availability and the rapid absorption is really, really important, which makes a big difference in terms of post-workout amino acid pool.
 We want to have one that's a little more broken down.
 The caveat to that is having an ability to digest whey and if it is really quick digesting and you have digestive issues, you're going to have a hard time with a very fast breaking down whey protein, like a hydrolysate.
 So, altering that potentially with a plant-based protein might be something you need to look into based off your ability to digest these really quick digesting proteins.

 The Momentous Minute with Tim Caron
 Today's Momentous Minute is with Tim Caron, the owner of Allegiate Gym and performance engineer at Momentous, the sports nutrition company on a mission to clean up the supplement industry.
 Today's question is how much protein can be consumed and utilized by the body at one time and what can alter protein consumption?
 Tim Caron:
 It depends a lot on your ability to digest proteins and your overall body mass.
 More muscle mass usually leads to more overall calories or individual macronutrients, in general, in specific to protein.
 So, when we take protein in abundance, this has a high satiety level and satiety means that we're going to get filled really fast.
 It's really difficult to determine an exact amount, but typically the bigger you are and the better you digest proteins, the more you can do that, which leads to the quality of the protein.
 You don't need as much when you have a higher quality of protein relative to eating a lower quality of protein mixed with some other things that might affect your actual satiety levels - like high sugar, maybe really processed foods, savory, salty foods.
 Getting higher quality protein, in conjunction with higher quality foods, helps your ability to digest and assimilate proteins at a higher level.

 The Momentous Minute with Tim Caron
 Today's Momentous Minute is with Tim Caron, the owner of Allegiate Gym and performance engineer at Momentous, the sports nutrition company on a mission to clean up the supplement industry.
 Today's question is when does it make sense to use a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) product? What does the research say about this?
 Tim Caron:
 BCAA's, in regards to what's actually in them, is a combination of leucine, isoleucine, and valine.
 Reasons why we want to have those three individually is largely due to getting leucine in our body.
 Leucine's an amino acid that's used during training, but it also stimulates the protein synthesis pathways.
 Now, in terms of what research is saying, a lot of it's actually leaning towards more essential amino acids and having amino acids that your body's not capable of producing kind of covers a lot more bases.
 If we're looking at getting our leucine levels to stimulate one energy production during training, as well as protein synthesis, having a lot more coverage in terms of all the essential amino acids is definitely where research is leaning towards and showing more promise.
 BCAA's still hold weight and can still be effective, just more research is leaning towards using essential amino acids.

 The Momentous Minute with Tim Caron
 Today's Momentous Minute is with Tim Caron, the owner of Allegiate Gym and performance engineer at Momentous, the sports nutrition company on a mission to clean up the supplement industry.
 Now, we've talked about the NSF certification before and the question today is when it comes to supplements, when do we need to look at with this certification (the NSF certification)?
 Tim Caron:
 If you're an athlete you should always be conscientious of what you're putting in your body.
 If you're someone who's competing you should always have a high standard in what you put in your body.
 In general, if you're investing in supplements you should always have the highest possible standard of what you're putting in your body, that makes a huge difference.
 And, when you're really evaluating your process of training and nutrition and supplements opting for the highest quality caliber of things to do and having a third party (NSF is the most widely respected independent certification organization today) that that actually can comes in and help you make that decision.
 It makes that process just a little bit easier, as well as a little clearer, on what you need to do.

 The Momentous Minute with Tim Caron
 Today's Momentous Minute is with Tim Caron, the owner of Allegiate Gym and performance engineer at Momentous, the sports nutrition company on a mission to clean up the supplement industry.
 Tim, today's question is what's most important to look for in protein supplements and how do we sort through so many different options that are available today?
 Tim Caron:
 Ingredient list. Look at the back of the label and actually seeing what's in there. Can you pronounce the ingredients? Do they look familiar? Are these things that you feel like something that wouldn't be hazardous to your body?
 I think there's a lot of intuition that should be used when you're looking at any supplements. The quality of the ingredients matters and as we dissect each one of these proteins, they have to have these products that have a shelf life and also have some sort of ability to break down and taste good when you're mixing it.
 So, looking at the back of the label and making sure it's grass-fed, making sure it's organic, making sure you can enunciate each one of those names makes a big difference in terms of how your body's going to react to that.
 Looking at the nutrition label should be paramount in most people's process of evaluating everything. Make that your first and foremost priority and you should be okay.

Real Recovery Talk,"If you or a loved one are battling alcoholism or drug addiction, this podcast will give you inspiration and hope that there is a way out.  Addiction isn't a life sentence.  People recover everyday. It takes time and some hard work, but in the end it is worth it! Hosted by Tom Conrad, a recovering alcoholic and drug addict himself.  Tom shares from his own experiences and the experiences of others to teach you the things that you can do TODAY to start living a sober and free lifestyle! 5 Min or Less
 It is not weak to admit defeat!
 I am an addict. I am an alcoholic.
  
 In this video we discuss the importance of qualifying.
 We have the only disease, that tells us we don’t have  it, that has to be self diagnosed.
 If I do not admit to myself that I have a problem, I am most likely not going to seek out a solution. Admitting that I am an alcoholic or a drug addict, is simply stating that I need to change.
 When the pain of staying the same, becomes greater than the pain of change, is when change occurs. Does it need to be said? Does it need to be said by me? Does it need to be said by me right now?
 After putting down the drink and drug, my next goal was to figure out how to live life.
 How can I live life in such a way that minimizes anxiety, worry, resentment or the like?
 I know that if I live my life feeling these negative feelings as a constant, I will eventually go back to the “ease and comfort” of a substance.
 So my new job is to minimize the amount of time that I have these feelings. The question is, how do I keep these feelings to a minimum? That begins with making sure that I do not put myself in such situations to begin with.
 How can I best avoid confrontation and conflict so that these feelings don’t arise? First of all, I need to learn how to communicate with others. One of the best ways to do this, is to figure out when and where to involve myself in disagreements.
 I have come to find that by just sitting back and keeping my mouth shut, I find myself in less confrontation. Time heals all wounds.
 What may have seemed like a big deal today, may mean nothing by tomorrow. If I had just kept my mouth shut, I could’ve avoided a lot of confrontation. You are who you surround yourself with!
 The people that we choose to hang around with will directly affect the level of success we achieve throughout our sobriety. If we choose to hang out with losers, we will lose. If we choose to hang with winners, we will win.
 This goes for anybody in life. Not just people getting sober. If you want to be a successful business person then hang out with successful business people. If you want to be a successful mountain climber hang out with successful mountain climbers. Although this sounds very surface level it is the absolute truth.
 Often times people claim they want to be “sober”  but spend the majority of their time doing things that non-sober people would do. Sobriety means so much more than just putting down the drink or the drug.  It is about changing our lifestyle. And that often times means changing our people, places and things. We need to have a total mindset shift when getting sober and that happens by hanging out with people that resemble sobriety.
 Stick with the winners!!! So you think you know what it means to surrender in recovery?
 A term that gets thrown around a lot in recovery is the word surrender.
 It sounds good when you say it, but do you really know what it means? Do you really know what you’re committing to? I thought surrender meant to go over to the winning side, or give up.
 Come to find out, it means “to agree to the terms of peace.” Meaning, if you want peace, there is going to be terms. There may still even be consequences.
 Just because I surrender, doesn’t necessarily mean I get to go home free. I’m probably still gonna have to go to jail or report to court at some point. That doesn’t sound fun!￼￼￼
 Point is, surrender is usually followed up with some sort of commitment, task, consequence or the like￼. When I surrender to a life of recovery, it means that I am going to have to do some work to find and keep the PEACE.

 If you are going to take the plunge into getting sober, you have to understand that it is going to take a lot of hard work. I sometimes think that people are under the misconception that getting sober is just about stopping using drugs and alcohol. That is very far from the truth.
  
 I have noticed that when things get hard for people that is when they tend to quit. When challenges arise, or uncomfortability sets in, then they’ll throw in the towel. This is the time that you have to knuckle down and do the work that you don’t necessarily want to do. When you are in addiction treatment it is hard work. If you want to get anything out of treatment itself you have to be willing to work hard, be vulnerable, be honest and grind it out
 If you’re able to continue to work hard and to put forth all your efforts into your sobriety you will succeed. I can guarantee sobriety for anybody that is willing to work hard, nonstop! Don’t come into this looking for an end date or a graduation certificate. Come into this understanding that there is no end date and this isn’t something you graduate from, it’s a lifestyle. 5 min or Less
  
  
 I can see straight through your “stage-character!”
  
 There is a reason 30 days is not enough to get to the underlying issues and the root of the problem.
  
 Every client comes into treatment presenting their stage character. This is the person that they want everybody to think they are, so they can get the reputation they think they deserve.
  
 Funny thing is, this usually gives way after about three weeks. When a client is under the watchful eye of a facility, they can only keep their character defects hidden for so long.
  
 Their true character will eventually come out. This is a good thing.
  
 It exposes the truth about their personality and character. A personality and character that must change in order for an individual to attain long-term sobriety.
  
 My sponsor told me, I didn’t have a drug and alcohol problem; I had a personality problem.
  
 So let me ask you. If it takes a treatment team around three weeks to see what the underlying issues are, how are we supposed to fix that in a remaining week? This is assuming the client committed to 30 days of treatment. This is why it is so highly recommended that somebody commit to around 90 to 120 days at minimum.
  
 Years of drug and alcohol addiction can not be undone in 30 days! This is assuming, you are of course the real deal addict or alcoholic. 
  
 In my case, I have the PRIVILEGE of participating in recovery everyday for the rest of my life! And it is awesome!"

Realfooding Life,"Realfooding Life, el podcast donde hablamos de cómo llevar un estilo de vida saludable. Desde la alimentación y la actividad física pasando por nuestra vida social. Todo para aprender a ser un auténtico realfooder. En el episodio de esta semana del podcast hemos visto y analizado los diferentes factores que influyen en la pérdida de grasa.



Antes de comenzar con el tema de hoy nos gustaría contaros y agradecer a Storytel, la plataforma de entretenimiento de streaming de audiolibros, e-books y podcasts, el patrocinio de este podcast.



Storytel es como el Netflix de los audiolibros donde podéis escuchar contenido de calidad de la categoría que prefiráis; novela, ficción, crecimiento personal, historia y mucho más.



Para los oyentes de este podcast traemos una oferta especial de 30 días gratis para escuchar todos los libros que quieras. Entra en Storytel y consigue 30 días de prueba gratis.



Pérdida de grasa



Antes de nada, como siempre, recordad que no existen dietas milagro, ni operaciones bikini que valgan más que llevar una vida saludable y una alimentación basada en el Realfooding.



Entre los factores podemos encontrar: 



Alimentación



Tener la capacidad y la accesibilidad a una buena alimentación no es complicado, debemos basarnos en comida real, priorizando materias primas sin procesamiento, locales y de temporada para también vincularnos con esa necesidad social de conservar el planeta y reducir entre todos el impacto ambiental que generamos. 



Desde Realfooding y en Mi Menú Realfooding tenemos muy en cuenta este aspecto y cuidamos los alimentos que incluimos en nuestros menús para que comenzar a ser realfooder sea muy sencillo y se ahorre tiempo y dinero.



Deporte y actividad física



Es cierto que debe producirse un déficit calórico y el deporte juega un papel crucial. El sedentarismo mata a muchas personas cada año y estamos centrándonos a veces en otros aspectos que no son tan influyentes sin dar un buen consejo de salud pública ni fomentar la educación física. 



Y tenemos que hacer un ejercicio de reflexión, ir andando al trabajo es positivo, caminar para hacer la compra, para recoger a la familia, para cualquier actividad que hagamos lo es, y tenemos que comenzar por movernos más, que no es lo mismo que hacer deporte. 



Descanso y estrés



Podemos seguir la misma dieta, hacer el mismo ejercicio físico pero, tener diferentes resultados. 



Además de lo que hemos hablado, el estrés y la ansiedad influyen a nivel hormonal en, por ejemplo, el patrón de descanso, cómo comemos, cómo vamos a hacer deporte, qué actitud tenemos. 



El cortisol, la hormona del “estrés” favorece la aparición del apetito y el contexto obesogénico en el que vivimos, con alimentos hiperpalatables y malsanos, tampoco contribuyen a que ese apetito sea saciado con un alimento y no un producto. 



El hecho de que también estemos descansando mal, luces artificiales, pantallas constantes y exposición a estímulos constantemente también puede contribuir a que se nos haga más difícil reducir esa grasa, por reducir el descanso. 



Como siempre, muchas gracias por escucharnos, por esas valoraciones de 5 estrellas en Apple Podcasts, vuestros comentarios y me gusta en iVoox y por los corazones verdes en Spotify. Además, puedes escucharnos también en Lecton App y en Storytel.

Reconciling Medicine,"We are the Doctors Paro, and welcome to the Reconciling Medicine Podcast. We are a dual physician couple in practice - and for over a decade we’ve been navigating the ups, downs and in-betweens of this profession......together.  We’ve done a lot of things right, and we’ve made plenty of mistakes.  Some say the practice of medicine is dying - it’s not.  But it is changing and we must adapt.  This podcast is an exploration of our relationship with medicine - how we fit it into our lives, how it affects the people we love, and why we are optimistic about the future.  We believe that with the right commitment and mindset we can all learn how to Reconcile Medicine. The Doctors Paro solve the opioid crisis.  (Or, at least talk about it for a while.)

Redefining Health &amp; Wellness,"In this podcast, Shohreh Davoodi, a HAES-informed Certified Intuitive Eating Counselor and Certified Personal Trainer, explores the limiting messages we receive about health and wellness and the harm those messages can cause. The podcast exposes common myths and misconceptions about health and wellness and critiques the diet culture and wellness culture that we're living in. Shohreh's goal is to help her listeners redefine health and wellness for themselves by delving into all the aspects of health that often get ignored, including mental health, emotional health, spiritual health, sexual health, financial health, social health, environmental health, and occupational health. While the podcast is focused on health and wellness, Shohreh recognizes that neither health nor wellness is a moral obligation and that they can’t be discussed in a vacuum - they are affected by racism, sexism, capitalism, ageism, classism, and more. The Girl Gang is back and more ridiculous than ever. In this episode, we tackle tons of topics that ""ladies"" are not supposed to speak openly and honestly about, from periods to farts to orgasms. Societal conditioning has taught us that it's inappropriate to talk about our own weird and wild bodies, so this episode is our way of calling b******t on that and extinguishing some of the shame we learned growing up. You can find the show notes and a full transcript of this episode at www.shohrehdavoodi.com/30. There’s a good chance today’s episode with sex educator Jamie J. LeClaire will answer at least one question you’ve always wanted to ask about sex but have been too embarrassed to. We chatted about pleasure, sexual boundaries, masturbation, sex toys, ethical porn, and even butt stuff (yep, we went there). You can find the show notes and a full transcript of this episode at www.shohrehdavoodi.com/29.

TW: Some discussion of Jamie's eating disorder Mainstream fitness culture got you down? Thank goodness non-diet, Health At Every Size-aligned personal trainers like Karen Preene exist. Karen and I talked about the value of taking intentional breaks, what joyful movement actually is, and how to have a healthier relationship with exercise. You can find the show notes and a full transcript of this episode at www.shohrehdavoodi.com/28. Sharon Hoefer works with college students to create campus communities that value consent and healthy relationships. In this episode, she and I discussed ways to build a culture of care to combat the rape culture we’re currently living in, the importance of learning to both deal with and dole out rejection, and more. You can find the show notes and a full transcript of this episode at www.shohrehdavoodi.com/27.

TW: Discussion of interpersonal violence, sexual assault, rape culture, etc. Every year, millions of people eagerly set New Year's resolutions only to abandon them shortly thereafter. In this episode, I attempt to help you avoid that fate by explaining how to set more effective goals for yourself. You can find the show notes and a full transcript of this episode at www.shohrehdavoodi.com/26. If you think that meditation and mindfulness are trendy wellness fads not worth pursuing, psychotherapist Neathery Thurmond might just change your mind. She and I talked about the effects of stress and trauma in the body, how meditation helps us integrate our brains, and the many different forms mindfulness can take in our lives.

Regular Infantry Guys Podcast,"Two veterans discuss what it was like transitioning out of military service and going to college. Brian Tally, a former SGT in the United States Marine Corps was severely injured due to the incompetence of several doctors and ER staff, at the VA hospital in Loma Linda, Ca. His misdiagnosis led to months of neglect and malpractice, that eventually nearly cost him his life. After nearly a year long battle with the VA’s General Counsel attorneys, Brian was denied compensation for his injuries, because the VA had concluded the accused physician was not a VA employee, but an “independent contractor” working within the VA. The VA also concluded that it’s not responsible, or accountable for the injuries and malpractice due to the current FTCA law / Contractor Exception.
 Brian is now on a mission to change the law to protect all veterans from unidentified “independent contractors,” and to ensure that VA is transparent and fully accountable.
  
  Brian Tally Website The epic story of the U.S. Army’s 10th Mountain Division, whose elite soldiers broke the last line of German defenses in Italy’s mountains in 1945, spearheading the Allied advance to the Alps and final victory.
 
 At the start of World War II, the US Army had two cavalry divisions—and no mountain troops. The German Wehrmacht, in contrast, had many well-trained and battle-hardened mountain divisions, some of whom by 1943 blocked the Allied advance in the Italian campaign. Starting from scratch, the US Army developed a unique military fighting force, the 10th Mountain Division, drawn from the ranks of civilian skiers, mountaineers, and others with outdoor experience. The resulting mix of Ivy League students, park rangers, Olympic skiers, and European refugees formed the first specialized alpine fighting force in US history. By the time it deployed to Italy at the beginning of 1945, this ragtag group had coalesced into a tight-knit unit. In the months that followed, at a terrible cost, they spearheaded the Allied drive in Italy to final victory.
 
 Ranging from the ski slopes of Colorado to the towering cliffs of the Italian Alps, The Winter Army is a saga of an unlikely band of soldiers forged in the heat of combat into a brotherhood whose legacy lives on in US mountain fighters to this day
  The Winter Army Amazon Book Store Every step of their journey there was one incident or decision that changed the direction of the outcome. Despite the physical, emotional and spiritual exhaustion, these small, yet conclusive, victories provided hope to persevere through the storms of life.
  
 Operation Decisive Victory was founded to be that sense of hope for members of the veteran and first responder communities. Many times the ‘war at home’ is fought alone because civilians simply do not understand. This organization strives to work with government and private institutions alike to ensure the services provided for our military members are continuous and seamless for the individuals or families impacted.  There are no qualifiers, bureaucracy, limitations or red tape that will restrict us from assisting a veteran in need.

        Chad Cole, a young US Marine Rifleman experiences the strains of the Marine Corps in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War. In a raw and looping narrative, Chad teaches the reader the importance of hearing and telling war stories from Vietnam and Desert Storm and also offers up his own experience with Lima Company 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines during Operation Peacemaker, the military response to the 1992 Rodney King Riot, in Los Angeles, California. By 1995 the young Sergeant leads a squad from 2nd Platoon, Lima Company 3/1, during Operation United Shield, the final United Nations withdrawal from ""the dirty little war,"" of Mogadishu, Somalia. The author was awarded the Navy Achievement Medal for Valor and the Combat Action Ribbon for his actions during United Shield.

 In May of 2010 the Marines of India Battery 3/12 deployed to the volatile Kajaki district of Helmand Province, Afghanistan. For the next 7 months they would be involved in daily contact with a well entrenched enemy force, while securing the critical infrastructure of the Kajaki Dam. With over 25% of the unit wounded and 5 Killed in Action, the men prevailed in the toughest fight of their lives together. Their deployment bonded them as family - brothers in arms - who would forever share a commitment to each other.
 In the years that followed many found themselves in a new fight: the fight to find their next mission in post-military life. The unit needed to face that challenge like they had all others: together. Five years after their return from combat India Battery renewed their commitment to each other. On Memorial Day Weekend 2015, the Marines of India Battery reunited, joined by the Gold Star families of those they lost. Together with a community that rose up to support them the Marines celebrated their history, honored their fallen, and connected with actionable resources to support each other.
 Out of that life-changing and life-saving event the Warrior Reunion Foundation was born. Our team's mission is to ensure every unit has this same opportunity to reconnect. We leverage our experience, partnerships and resources to deliver unparalleled, all-inclusive unit reunion events that enable warriors to reunite, remember and recover together. SFC John Herbst joins me on this episode to discuss his reasoning for serving after 9/11 and how his deployment affects him to this day. He was honest and vulnerable during the conversation of what ""eats"" at him everyday and how his new purpose in life has helped him get back on the right track in life. You'll enjoy this episode and learn from struggles that we all go through at some point during our transition out of military service. Thanks for listening to his story.

Everyone has a goal to chase.  


Your goal can be to lose weight, be faster or stronger than they were yesterday.  But why do you stop chasing after that goal? What stops you from taking it to the next level? 


The reason is... people want the results right now, instead of appreciating the journey.  The real secret to success in not how fast you can get to your goal but

2) Feeling amazing from those small wins 
3) Changing your life for the better along the way

What made Mike change the type of exercise he was doing


What is Animal Flow and how you can benefit from it


Animal Flow's business model


Creating Animal Flow onDemand


 
Key Takeaways:


The most advanced piece of machinery that we have is our body. There is so much we can do with it; it's extraordinary.


Depending on how we use our body, how we position it in space, we can increase the percentage of body load that we're using, we can change the lever to make a movement harder.


Animal Flow is a ground-based movement program that's designed to reconnect your body to itself through the floor.


Animal flow is going back to the basics, going back to replicating animal movement patterns, and you can do it anywhere.


With Animal Flow you don't need a lot of equipment, you don't have to be in a gym, you don't need access to a personal trainer, you just need to learn it.


 
Action Steps:


Think of longevity and train to last.


Take ownership of your body and see what you can do with it.


 
Mike said:
""It's empowering to me to think that you don't need anything else and YOU are the best piece of equipment.""
 
""There's something to be said about taking ownership of your body and taking ownership of your system and how it works and how it moves...""

Vi... With all the changes that have been happening in the world of genetics, how can we re-imagine our health? Olympian and genetics expert Andrew Steele shares about Circle DNA, and how you can personalise your health, fitness, and wellbeing through DNA testing.

Topics Discussed in this Episode:


How you can personalise your health, fitness, and wellbeing through DNA testing.


How our understanding of genetics has changed in the last couple of years as it relates to diet and nutrition


What Circle DNA is all about


Epigenetics and the lifestyle changes that you can make with what your genes tell you about YOU


 
Key Takeaways:


There's a gene called ACTN3 which is probably the most researched gene elite power and performance. You can either have the CC genotype, the TT genotype, or the CT genotype.


The CC or the CT genotype of the ACTN3 are extremely over-represented in elite power athletes.


Historically, research was largely funded for genetic research into life-changing medical conditions. What's happened in the last couple of years, as the technology has become cheaper and cheaper to do the laboratory part of the process, research has now included lifestyle and health.


The cheaper the technology becomes, the more research can be done cheaply, therefore the better discoveries can be made and the better products you can make from them become cheaper.


Circle DNA is the world's most comprehensive direct-to-consumer DNA test.


 
Action Steps:


Get DNA testing and find out:




What type of exercise your body responds best to


How you should structure your eating plan


How you can work with your genes and not against them


 
Andrew said:
""Genetics is only one part of the picture, albeit a power part of the picture nonetheless.""""In the last couple of years, there has been a further [democratisation] and a mass understanding of the role of genetics in things outside of just the clinical context.""

Topics Discussed in this Episode:


Mercer's 2018 Global Talent Trends Study


Wellbeing in the workplace


How companies will change in terms of competing for talent


Game-changing companies and how they compete


 
Key Takeaways:


The 3 things that make people enjoy their job and feel happy to be at work:




Policies around flexibility


The company's purpose


The company's commitment to health and wellbeing

 


Most of us work in a company that's much bigger than ourselves, that isn't owned by us, so we fit into somebody else's definition of the culture. This can make it quite tricky to manage good wellbeing.


How companies will be competing against each other for people's talents and time is going to be changing, and it's going to be centered more around wellbeing.


Companies who are truly game-changing, who understand what wellbeing is and its importance, will compete using their wellbeing strategy as the lead.


 
Action Steps:


If you're an employer, you should be deeply interested in things like resilience, life changes, self-care, wellbeing, and weight management for your people.


Educate yourself on how to be more resilient, how to manage self-care, how to handle life changes, how to sleep better, how to have good mental health and how to keep yourself energised.


With regards to flexibility, purpose, commitment to health and wellbeing, when you're looking around for a role or evaluating a current role, ask some questions around the flexible working scheme:




Do they have an agile working scheme? Do they have a work-from-home policy? And then ask how often it's actually used. Talk to members of your future team and ask them what happens in reality when you ask to work from home. And ask whether leaders do this. Ask lots of questions about how it works in practice.


Figure out your own purpose and look for a company that enables you to live out that purpose, that embodies all your values.


Ask a lot of questions in the health and wellbeing commitment piece. Find out how that works in the company.


 
Leanne said:
""A wellbeing policy that's built around the many different values people have makes you want to stay somewhere. It's a great tool for attracting and retaining employees.""
""Assuming that those are your priorities -- flexibility, purpose, How do you, as an individual, see your place in the world? In this episode, children's books author Suzanne Hemming shares her thoughts about having a sense of equality, confidence, and self-esteem.
Visit https://www.bodyshotperformance.com/topic/podcasts/ (https://www.bodyshotperformance.com/topic/podcasts/) for the complete show notes of every podcast episode.
 
Topics Discussed in this Episode:


Raising awareness of the lack of gender equality in the world


What we can do to get more equality


The messaging that we give young children about masculinity and femininity


Toxic masculinity and how the feelings of inequality affect children's wellbeing and their mental and physical health later on in life


How getting connected to her own personal values improved Suzanne's wellbeing


 
Key Takeaways:


Examples of toxic masculinity, according to Suzanne, are people using phrases like ""Man up"", ""Don't cry like a girl"", ""Don't run like a girl"", ""Just toughen up"", ""Take it like a man"", ""Boys will be boys.""


Suzanne views toxic masculinity as society's desire for men to behave a certain way, a way that is seen as masculine, strong, capable, not showing emotion. It's toxic because of the impact that it has on both the wellbeing or men, the wellbeing of women, and how they interact with each other.


Anyone who is not living as their authentic self -- who they are, how they feel, what they think -- regardless of their gender or their age, is going to be living with a certain amount of unhappiness.


 
Action Steps:


Help build awareness of the messaging we give children about masculinity and femininity and its impact on their mental health and wellbeing.


 
Suzanne said:
""Little boys who believe that they shouldn't cry, that they should not do anything like a girl, that they should be manning up all the time and being tough all the time... they're going to be living with a certain amount of unhappiness.
""Boys who are told not to show their feelings when they're little boys will grow up into men who don't feel that they can show their feelings as men. They will grow up into men who won't cry, who will ignore feelings of sadness, of despair, who will treat each other differently...""

Book mentioned: Atomic Habits by James Clear  Welcome to 2020!!! I recorded this early on New Years Eve and to be honest I love the energy in January. I love the feeling of a fresh new start, the optimism of a new year, the goal setting - I love all of it! However, I understand there is often excessive pressure placed on resolutions &amp; goals - that's the part I don't love. Let's take a breath, set goals that feel good, and make an action plan that works for your life so you can succeed. On this episode I talk to my friend Stephanie Rosenfield who is a LIFE COACH! Wow did I need this conversation. This time of year can be stressful for many people so we discuss how to deal with difficult family members, tune out social media pressure and the idea of trying to avoid negative emotions - spoiler alert: you can't  avoid them. Steph offers amazing tools that will help transform the way we approach sticky life situations. 
Find Steph on the gram @stephanielrosenfield or stephaniercoaching.com My hubby is back on the podcast to discuss how his eating habits have evolved since we've been together, his 30+ lb weight loss and how he balances his healthy lifestyle with the occasional burger.  We discuss how to encourage your partner/roomate/loved one to develop healthy habits without pushing. He feels better now than he ever has and says what he eats is 90% of the reason. Let me know what you think! This weeks episode is meant to calm the common fears &amp; limiting beliefs around food.  It's so much more than calories in vs calories out when it comes to eating/hunger/celebrations and there is usually an emotional component.  Let's keep it simple, stay grateful and eat according to our goals.  Sound too easy? Just listen! xo

She is helping women un-learn the toxic diet culture in our society and instead she teaches a science-backed, holistic approach to mental and physical wellness that will last a lifetime - it's of course the amazing Sarah Liz King.

For those of you who don't know Sarah, she is an exercise physiologist, a health coach and a public speaker.

In this episode you'll learn:

 • 

 • What intuitive and mindful eating is and why it can work for you.
 • 

 • To shift your focus to how you feel rather than how you look.
 • 

 • What health really means and why what we see in the media isn't representative of the population.
 • 

 • That it's okay to open up about not feeling perfect 100% of the time.
 • 

 • To learn to remove the black and white thinking we have around food and realise that food is just food!

 What do I feel strongly/passionate about and why? 
 What brings me true happiness? How can I create more of this in my life? 
 What is in the way of my happiness? How can I change this or let this go? 
 What is my biggest regret? Why? How can I let this go? 
 What is in the way of achieving my goals (physical, mental, emotional blocks)? Why? What can I do to move past this?

Ricky Brodie - Lean Lifestyle,"Online fitness coach providing you with the information you need to create a positive lifestyle and keep you fit, healthy & lean! In this episode Ricky talks about how sometimes going in 100% can actually slow down your results. Having something a bit more maintainable will lead to better results. 

Things covered

- nutrition
- training
- recovery
- balance
- maintainable approach In this episode Ricky talks about how he takes people through their transformations with their nutrition &amp; cardio. 

12 week transformation of nutrition &amp; cardio

First 4 weeks control your calorie intake. Don’t over complicate. Use food you enjoy and introduce as much whole foods as possible. Reduce trigger foods and avoid take aways.2,000 - 2,400 - 20 mins pwo +12.5k steps


4-8 weeks introduce a calorie cycling approach that allows you to train in a higher calorie state to keep performance but on rest days have a lower calorie approach to achieve more fat loss but don’t reduce calories too low to the point you can’t function daily. 1,800 - 2,200 25 minutes pwo + 15k steps


8-12 Continue the same process of weeks 4-8 but introduce low, medium &amp; high calorie days to bring on more fat loss whilst performance still stays good and recovery.  1,600 - 1,800 - 2,400 30 mins pwo + 15k steps 

Food stay pretty much the same and cardio output will increase Episode #6 Ricky talks about managing your routine and how important this is for results. He provides you with tips of how and why it can make a difference! 

www.Rickybrodiefitness.co.uk Weight maintenance is probably one of the most difficult but at the same time easy part of the journey. It’s difficult because coming off the back of any dieting phase you will find yourself wanting to consume all the calories you can and eat all the meals you craved throughout the dieting process but also cut out your cardio. This is a massive NO, you should have some structure after your dieting phase or you will lose everything you worked hard for and also most likely rebound to a higher bodyweight after. Don’t cover this uncontrollable process with the stamp of ‘bulking’ because adding body fat does not mean you’re adding muscle. Stay in control.
 

Personally after my photoshoot I’ve kept my weight within 5lbs over 3 months and it has almost been effortless. I’ve managed to keep on top of my habits, enjoy social events and train hard. It has been a perfect blend for me and I have many clients going through the same process.

 

The reason this part of the journey can actually be quite easy is due to the fact that you can be a bit more lenient with your intake and output. For example, if you do decide to eat 200-300 calories more one day you know it’s not going to put you into a huge excess of calories that would lead to adding noticeable amounts of body fat. Also you should have increased your calories slightly and this will lead to you have more energy, this means your ability to make decisions with food should improve and you can train harder in the gym.

 

It’s important to accept the fact that you will gain a bit of body fat after your dieting phase. You need to find a place that your body settles at nicely when consuming around your maintenance calorie intake. Once you’re in this place, then you can decide if you should go into a lean gain phase or even a dieting phase again. I recommend spending a good 12 weeks in this phase, it will allow you to enjoy social events but also force you to maintain those very important habits you created during your diet phase. These are essential for building muscle and/or dropping body fat.

 

Being able to maintain your body weight is a very powerful thing, this can lead to better health, more energy and a less stressed body. If you’re eating too much or not eating enough you will be putting your body under stress, these are also known as ‘cutting’ and ‘bulking’ phases. Working with guys that want a strong, lean and athletic looking physique or the guys that just want to lose 10-15lbs, this understanding of a weight maintenance phase is essential.

 

4 things that will allow you to maintain your hard work and keep you focused. Many people claim to lose their focus after a dieting phase and motivation drops so using these principles you will continue to keep on top of things and keep progressing.

 

1.    Cap your body weight – This for me has been an absolute game changer and not just with me but with clients also. I got ready for a photoshoot in November and it’s now February. Using this weight cap system, I’ve managed to maintain my body weight better than ever. This has without a doubt been my most successful physique after a dieting phase. Put in a place a weight cap of 4-8lbs (depending on how much weight you’ve lost) and keep up tracking this. Once you go over this desired weight you make sure you put in the work to get it back down and then continue with your maintenance phase. I try to stay 2lbs below this number so when I eat out I stay within this number. Do this for 12 weeks and then decide what your next goal is.

 

2.    Track food, bodyweight &amp; activity – Continue to track these things, you don’t have to do it to perfection like you might have needed to do for a dieting phase but do keep on top of all these important factors that have helped you achieve the physique you have now. This will also set you up when you decide In this episode Ricky talks about the importance of self control and when it can be used. His own personal experience and working with others. In this episode Ricky speaks about how important it is to have the fundamentals in place before trying more advanced principles and explains what they are.

Focus on consistently executing the fundamentals and then look to advance 
- Daily step count/daily activity. get in the gym if you don’t meet it or go for a walk.
- Consistent calorie intake - don’t over complicate your diet
- Resistance training that you enjoy at least 3 times a week 
- Manage you routine.. sleep, food prep, gym prep &amp; time management"

Rienzo, Christine and Gerhard chat about how they negotiate, balance and squeeze in their Ironman training, 8 weeks out. Never underestimate the power of the support around you, from family, friends and loved ones.

""I have self-doubt. I have insecurity. I have fear of failure. I have nights when I show up at the arena and I'm like, 'My back hurts, my feet hurt, my knees hurt. I don't have it. I just want to chill.' We all have self-doubt. You don't deny it, but you also don't capitulate to it. You embrace it. "" Kobe Bryant An Italian, an Afrikaner and an English woman enter a triathlon. No jokes! 🤣 Christine, Gerhard and Rienzo chat about how they are dealing with hunger, hydration, weight loss, cravings, training nutrition and what their go-to products of choice are, 68 days out from Ironman SA.

You don't play triathlon. You play soccer; it's fun. You play baseball. Triathlon is work that can leave you crumpled in a heap, puking by the roadside.

Stay Fearless! Fearless Training Roar Knowledge Podcast Episode 33: Laurin Conlin - Redefining Healthy - Nutrition &amp; Female Strength Training 

Welcome back to the Fearless Training ""Roar Knowledge"" Podcast where we talk everything; Training, Nutrition &amp; Lifestyle.

Laurin Conlin, Owner and Head Coach
Laurin started Team LoCoFit with the mission to redefine healthy within the fitness industry. As a competitor within the industry, she saw both a lack of education and quality from many coaches. That is why Team LoCoFit focuses on quality coaching, putting the clients long term interests first and taking an educated, evidence based approach to all matters.

Laurin’s interest of nutrition started from a very disordered place; as she was anorexic for many years growing up. Her interest then shifted to nutrition and performance as a track and field athlete in high school, to then an amateur bodybuilder. She competed for several years as an NPC Figure competitor before making the switch to the Bikini division. In 2014, she won the overall at NPC Nationals in Bikini, earning her professional status. Laurin has competed for several years as an IFBB Bikini pro since.

She attended the Florida State University for her undergraduate degree, pursuing a Bachelors in Exercise Science. She then went on to complete her Masters in Exercise Science from University of South Florida in Dr. Bill Campbell’s lab. Laurin’s Masters research focused on how different dieting strategies effect weight loss and weight regain. Particularly, looking at a ‘flexible’ diet where no foods are excluded versus a meal plan, where foods were excluded. Her research was the first study to directly examine this relationship between these two diets.

Laurin travels to give lectures and seminars on a variety of topics including nutrition, training, psychological aspects of dieting, running a business and more. She hosts two podcasts, Redefine Healthy Radio and The UNglamorous Life. Additionally, Laurin works with several companies within the industry who align with her values and provide the best products and services within their market.

In this episode I will explain how my dance fitness class works - what participants can expect, how I teach - AND WHY - the layout, flow, playlist....it’s actually pretty straightforward, but maybe not everyone knows WHY I do WHAT I do; now I am going to explain! This is not a ‘teaching tutorial....’ this is my story. 😊 How ‘AWESOME’ soon became overwhelm. Trying to figure out my next plan of action I ended up going independent. It has been an amazing experience with many peaks and lots of valleys. You may have experienced ‘with me,’ but unless you were dancing in my shoes, you really don’t know how it felt. Listen in! Figuring out that you are not being very successful at something is a tough pill to swallow. How do we find solutions to our current problems? How do we trouble shoot? How can we take constructive criticism &amp; make ourselves better &amp; be open to evolving? A very brief description of how a small town Montana girl ended up teaching in competitive dance, how I got into the dance fitness circle and why I decided to give my own podcast a go! Let’s get to know each other, shall we? My name is Tara - or in the dance fitness world I am known as ‘TRawckk.’ I am here to share &amp; talk about my love of dance - my true authentic love - music, fitness, community, why I do what I do and my passion for teaching and coaching others. I will also share how I think it’s possible to live a happy life and why everybody deserves to be living their best life."

Run with Purpose,"Run with purpose is a podcast where we discuss how when we focus on one step at a time we find purpose not only in the activity but in everything that you do! Every week I break down topics on living with more purpose and intention. Guests are often on the show sharing their journey and how they find purpose in what they do whether it's fitness, business or just ""ordinary"" life. Running has helped me gain the disciplines in my life to help me see my purpose, what is going to get you there? Every year I host a race where the participants are ""Running 'Cause they're Hangry, angry for those living with hunger!"" This week I go into the history of the Hangry Race Series and a year by year break down of the first 5 years of the race. I talk about the things I've learned to do to make it better and the things I won't dare do again. Registration for the 2020 Hangry Race Series opens on February 1, 2020, so check out our website and hope to see you on the trails!

Podcast details at www.flores.run/runwithpurpose Why do I run? Why do I get up so early? Why do I do what I do?


We all have ""why?"" type moments in our lives, but have you ever taken a moment to actually think through the why? Everything that we do has a why attached to it but does that why align with your values and purpose? This week I talk through this thought of mine of getting down to the ""why?"" in what we do and what we have in order to live a more purpose driven life.

RUN.,"RunLab™ is a motion analysis and gait retraining company comprised of medical professionals, elite runners, and biomechanics experts headquartered in Austin, Texas. RunLab works with runners virtually from anywhere in the United States through www.RunLab.us and has worked with thousands of runners, from Olympic gold medalists, junior Olympians, and world champions, to kids with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, and a host of movement disorders.Join us as we discuss common myths in the running industry and why there really is no ""right"" way to run. So much of running and life is about overcoming struggle. Physical challenges are a ""classroom"" where we learn to persevere. Through persevering, we create ""remember when"" moments that we recall upon in future difficult situations.

In this episode, we discuss our adventure racing experiences and how to use adventure racing to work on strengthening your mindset and overall athleticism. It can also serve as a fun break from the sometimes monotony of running. All of which leads to more enjoyable running.  Sitting is the new smoking. This statement has made its way into the public conscious and it's not too far from the truth. Becoming 
""civilized"" and sitting every day has led to an epidemic of movement dysfunction in our society which has resulted in declining health. In this episode, we talk about what sitting does to your body and how to combat the perils of sitting. 

By combatting what sitting does to you, you will not only improve your running but also improve your quality of life.  75-90% of runners will get an injury this year which will hold them back from reaching their goals. Our healthcare system is broken as it designed to treat symptoms rather than root causes and get you back to statistical averages, rather than optimization. 

In this episode, we talk about the current state of healthcare for runners and what the future holds. In addition, we discuss what the ideal ""pit crew"" team looks like for a runner to optimize their running experience. Plantar fasciitis and Achilles pain stop many runners in their tracks. In this episode, we talk about some of the common causes of these injuries and some of the remedies at your disposal. Topics include ankle, big toe, and foot mechanics in addition to the role of running shoes and tendon elasticity. We conclude with a case study, examining a recent real-world example of a client we just helped overcome their two-year chronic Achilles pain in seven weeks.  Which running shoe is the best one for you? Which one is going to help you stay injury-free and set new PRs? This week we want to help you answer these questions by discussing the history of running shoes. From the original Nike waffle to the introduction of medial posting to control pronation, barefoot running, max cushion, and the current trend of carbon fiber plates. We take a look at the pros/cons of each and the role running shoes actually play in optimizing your running stride. Technology is advancing quickly. We are able to capture millions of data points every second about our bodies.

Runcast - om løb for løbere,"En podcast der udelukkende handler om løb - for alle løbere. Om du løber hurtigt eller langsomt, 5K, halvmaraton, maraton eller ultraløb, på trails i skoven eller tæsker asfalt på landevejen. Runcast er for dig, der interesserer dig for løbets DNA og alt omkring det. Kort sagt - om løb for løbere! Marina Aagaard giver med sine mange års erfaringer nogle ganske simple “hands on” råd i forhold til, hvordan du starter med at løbetræne og ikke mindst, hvordan du holder ved… (Foto: Henrik Elstrup)



Om det er nytårsforsættet, der dikterer en start på træning i løbeskoene eller du er en garvet løber, der bare engang imellem er lidt udfordret i forhold til at holde ved med den gode vane, er det her en episode for dig.Runcast har sat Marina Aagaard i stævne til en snak om, hvordan du som løber starter fornuftigt op på din træning og ikke mindst, hvordan du lykkes med den svære kunst at holde ved.Og Marina Aagaard er en erfaren kvinde udi træning og motivation. I over 25 år har hun formidlet sundhed og træning med en solid baggrund i uddannelser indenfor både den fysiologiske og mentale side af motion.



Der er masser af gode artikler omkring motion, kost og motivation på Marinas blog. (Foto: Leif Nygaard)



Marinas 10 råd til hvordan du får motivation og holder ved din nye motionsvane:



Sæt mål og skaf resultaterDyrk de gode vanerGør hverdag til festHold vedVariation fryderGør god kost nemtKom (rigtigt) igang (igen)Tilpas din træningKlæd dig mentalt rigtigt påTræn udenom

Alle de 10 motivationsråd bliver naturligvis uddybet i denne episode af Runcast.



Marinas blog om sundhed, træning, motivation og livsstil finder du på http://marinaaagaardblog.com/ Endelig! I sit tredie forsøg gennemførte Martin Vangsgaard i 2019 Mors 100 Miles. Efter et årelangt misbrug blev løb hans vej ud af misbruget.



34-årige Martin Vangsgaards vej til passioneret ultraløber har været alt andet end snorlige. Efter han som spæd blev adopteret fra Libanon voksede han op i det trygge Mors – med en kernefamilie omkring sig og venner i miljøet omkring den ganske almindelige lille folkeskole.Men de usikre teenageår bød på fristelser, som Martin ikke kunne modstå.Og først mange år senere slap Martin fri af misbrugets favntag. Han fandt ro gennem løb generelt og de rigtige lange distancer i særdeleshed.



Landevejene omkring Mors er blevet Martins yndlings. Både når det gælder de mange træningstimer, men også i favoritløbet over dem alle “Mors 100 miles”.



Det endelige bevis på, at Martin endelig gennemførte Mors 100 Miles.



Ultraløbet pryder nu Martins ene læg.



100 Miles Mors starter på Nytorv i Nykøbing. Et sted, Martin kender så godt, da han faktisk selv bor der.



Du kan følge Martin og hans bedrifter på Facebook-siden “Martin Vangsgaard – Ultraløb – ud af misbrug”. Mike Skyte drømte om at løbe London Marathon og eneste mulighed for en garanteret plads var ved at løbe for en af de mange velgørenhedsorganisationer.



Har du først deltaget i ét maraton får du enten smag for mere, eller også tænker du ALDRIG mere. 



Er du blevet bidt af maratonbillen er det ikke ualmindeligt, at du kigger ud i verden for at deltage i de rigtigt store og helt vildt populære maraton. Men er det for eksempel New York eller London maraton, der er højest på din ønskeliste, er det desværre ikke bare lige at komme på deltagerlisten. Chancen for at vinde i lotteriet og blive udtrukket er lille og gerne nede i etcifrede procenter, og køber du deltagelse gennem en rejsearrangør er det ikke udsædvanligt, at du skal bestille flere år i forvejen. 



Den sidste mulighed er at løbe for en af de mange velgørenhedsorganisationer, der hvert år køber pladser til de populære maraton. Her forpligter du dig til at samle ind til en bestemt organisation mod at modtage et løbsnummer. 



Men hvordan foregår det egentlig  og er det let at få samlet nok penge ind?  Runcast satte Mike Skyte i stævne til en snak om charity running. I 2016 satte han sig for at løbe London Marathon, og den eneste mulighed for deltagelse var en billet gennem en indsamling til en velgørenhedsorganisation. 



Mike bor med sin kone og børn i Danmark, men hans accent afslører, at hans baggrund er lidt anderledes.



Mike samlede godt over 22.000 kroner ind til fordel for “Multiple Sclerosis Trust”. Så det var velfortjent, at han kunne sætte nummeret fast på brystet.



Mike har arbejdet en del år i London, og nød at kunne løbe midt ude på de normalt så trafikerede veje. Mette Birk Jensen er selv ultraløber. Hun bor og træner til dagligt i Thailand, men løb sine første 100 kilometer i Danmark, hvor ideen til Ultrakvinderne opstod. Bogen tager udgangspunkt i og forsøger at besvare de spørgsmål, hun selv stillede sig under sit første møde med de helt lange distancer. (Foto: Privat)



Fra den dag Mette Birk Jensen oplevede et ultraløb på sin egen krop, var hun hooked på de distancer, der ligger ud over maratondistancen. Fascinationen af ultradistancerne som løber og Mettes naturlige nysgerrighed fik hende til at søge efter bøger om ultraløb og ultraløbere.Men udvalget var begrænset på dansk og portrætter af kvindelige ultraløbere endnu mere sparsomt.Som den handlingens kvinde, Mette er, tænkte hun, at hun da så bare selv måtte skrive bogen.Resultatet ligger nu færdigt i bogform. “Ultrakvinderne  – om seje kvinder og ekstreme løb” hedder den. 200 sider spækket med portrætter af verdens sejeste ultrakvinder men også en bog fyldt med gode råd og indsigter i en verden af vilde løbedistancer og fantastiske anekdoter. Runcast satte Mette  i stævne til en snak om bogen, hendes egen erfaring med ultraløb, de ultrakvinder hun har interviewet og ikke mindst, hvordan man som ny ultraløber kan nærme sig en verden, der bare er ultra.



Mettes bog er et fascinerende indblik i ultraverdenen.



Du kan købe “Ultrakvinderne – Om seje kvinder og ekstreme løb” som ebog hos Muusmann Forlag eller SAXO.com.



Mette deler både sine egne erfaringer med ultradistancerne, men har også interviewet nogle af de absolut mest fascinerende og stærkeste ultrakvinder i verden.



Mettes debut på 100 km foregik under hjemlige himmelstrøg på Samsø. Et lidt andet klima end det thailandske, hvor hun bor sammen med sin kæreste. 29-årige Katharina Beckmann håber på at komme under 4 timer til Copenhagen Marathon. Submax- og en VO2maxtesten hos VO2LAB skulle give svaret på, om det er en mulighed.



Mens det altid har været kutyme for eliteløbere at få testet deres potentiale i forhold til træning og konkurrencer, har det været svært at komme i nærheden af denne form for test for os almindelige løbere.



Men i takt med at teknikken er blevet billigere, er denne form for løbetest rykket ud af laboratorierne og tilbydes nu motionsløberne til en fornuftig pris.



På Østerbro i København ligger VO2 Lab, der har specialiseret sig i at foretage en såkaldt submax test og en max test, hvorefter de ud fra resultaterne kan vejlede løberen i hvad han eller hun skal fokusere på i sin træning for at forbedre præstationen.







Runcast var en flue på væggen, da kæresteparret Katharina Beckmann på 29 år og Simon Sørensen på 33 år skulle testes op mod deres fælles store mål – København maraton under 4 timer.



Anders Spanggaard fra VO2LAB hjælper 33-årige Simon Sørensen på med udstyret, der skal måle hans maksimale iltoptagelse. 



Det er en blodig affære, men man må lide for videnskaben. Simon fik taget små blodprøve under løbetesten for at fastslå hans syregrænse.



Katharina og Simon er – udover at være kærester – også medlemmer af løbeklubben Sparta i Købehavn. Det var faktisk her, de mødte hinanden.



Hvad der tidligere var forbeholdt de få eliteløbere er nu muligt for også motionsløberne.



Hos VO2LAB koster en Submax- og VO2maxtest 1.100 kroner. Du kan bestille tid via deres hjemmeside.



Det er også muligt at følge VO2LAB på Instagram og Facebook. Det er ikke nok at være en god løber, når der skal prøves kræfter med OCR sporten. En stærk core og armkræfter er et must på de tekniske dele af ruten.



OCR! Nej, det er ikke en diagnose. Det er en af de hurtigst voksende sportsgrene i USA, og herhjemme er det også en sport i hastig vækst.   OCR – Obstacle Course Racing – eller slet og ret forhindringsløb – kombinerer løb og udholdenhed med styrke i core og arme.   Katja K. Christensen er én af Danmarks absolut bedste OCR udøvere med flotte placeringer både nationalt og internationalt.   Senest fik hun sølv til Europamesterskabet individuelt og var en del af det team, der bragte guld hjem til Danmark.   Vi bad Katja om at fortælle om hendes møde med OCR-sporten og om at give os et blik ind i en verden af mudder, armgang, kravlegange og ikke mindst – benhårdt løb.



Man skal bestemt ikke være for fin til mudder og koldt vand, når OCR-banerne skal forceres.



Katja K. Christensen er en af de absolut bedste OCR-atleter herhjemme. Men amatører er også velkommen til de forskellige stævner, hvor man får lov at gennemføre samme baner som eliten.



Løb er en helt essentiel del af træningen, så Katja bruger meget tid i løbeskoene. Men almindeligt løb kedede hende, og fik hende til at søge mod OCR-sporten.



“Jeg stopper ikke før, jeg bliver verdensmester,”  fortæller Katja til Runcast. Vi tror på hende.



Du kan følge Katja K. Christensen via hendes Facebookside eller Instagram.

First, Coach Jess of Enlighten Well LLC joins the podcast to talk about intuitive eating and the anti-diet challenge, which we are co-sponsoring along with SuperFitHero! Watch for her on this podcast over the next four weeks! When I trust people, the work is good and my expectations are being met, “good job!” feels….kinda stupid. Pedantic. Terribly insufficient. Kris Zarnoch deserves better than that, so as she heads to the start line of her first marathon, an entire podcast devoted to the importance of this podcast outlining its impact on our community as well as the viability of our business, still didn’t feel like enough but it’s better than a mug that says, “World’s Best Podcast Editor”."

Running Your Stories,"Running Your Stories is a podcast to share stories from runners in the pack! Stories that more people can relate to as these are ordinary people. UK based podcast with friends around the world. We hope that you can find a story to inspire you! After 3 years of working towards it, in January 2020 I (Kev) attempted The Montane Spine Race! 268 miles of tough trails, with a heavy pack in brutal mid winter conditions! Dropping out after 120 miles sets a new furthest distance covered but was obviously not the desired outcome. So many lesson's learnt and the best of all how great the trail / ultra community are. So many positive messages about how good it is to see people taking on something so challenging and giving it a proper go. Don't be afraid to ""fail""! What a wonderful community we have. In this podcast Kim comes along to ask the questions about all aspects of the race and my (Kev's) experience at trying to go over 200 miles and trying to compete in The Spine Race. Thanks Kim! 
Many thanks to Harshan Gill of Peak Exposure for the excellent picture! https://www.facebook.com/harsharngillphotography/  Richard Staite. Calm, understated, calculating. Richard currently runs ultras such as TDS, cycles (whole tour de France route), and competes in Iron Man races. That is just the tip of the iceberg! Richard describes how he loves the process of learning a sport, developing himself and others around him. A method, drive and love that has led Richard on a sporty journey to row for Great Britain and climb mount Everest on his way to his current conquests! This is a great, wide ranging chat about sport, as Richard says, “Enjoy the puzzle!""
Stop Press! Between recording the podcast and publishing Richard together with partner Anna finished in 2nd and 3rd place overall at the 100mile Exodus Ultra in the Brecon Beacons of Wales!  The tables have turned! In this episode Milly Troup asks the questions as she interviews Kev about his recent 4th male, 5th overall finish at the Hardwolds 80, an 80 mile trail race in Yorkshire! Milly goes on to ask about Kev's training and looks forward to Kev taking on the epic 268 miles of the Montane Spine Race in January! 
If you'd like to know more about Milly then please listen to Episode 30 about Milly's successful completion of the Javelina Jundred at age 16! Thank you so much Milly!  Milly Troup, at 16 years old has just completed the Javelina Jundred 100 mile race. We catch up with Milly a few weeks after the race to reflect on her life changing experience. Milly's maturity can perhaps be summed up big highlighting that not once in the interview does she talk about winning the trophy for being the youngest finisher.
Milly has learned some great life lessons and grown in a way that takes many people at least twice as many as her mere 16 years. Anne Marie Lord is an accomplished ultra runner who recently completed a treble of runs across England, Scotland and Wales. Each of those nearing 200 miles! Anne Marie is well known in her local running community for supporting other runners, encouraging all runners, especially women to progress. Anne Marie has an infectious enthusiasm for ""being out there"", enjoying the great outdoors. 
King Offa's Dyke, Race Across Scotland and Race Across Great Britain are just a few of Anne Marie's most notable achievements. Not to mention over 100 parkrun first female results among many other completions and great accomplishments. 
Anne Marie encourages everyone to work toward their dreams and goals, ""you never know, it could be you!"" It could be you finishing the challenge of a lifetime, it could be you standing on the podium, it can be you if you work for it. You can achieve it. What a wonderful message from Anne Marie who is the embodiment of the message.  Huge thanks to Shelli for chatting about this sensitive subject. This episode talks about some of the difficulties of mental health, ""it's OK not to be OK"". The episode had been planned for some time but we discussed whether to postpone in light of another tragedy in the running community.

There is an index page that lists all the episodes in one place.  Every year we have a gathering in northern Idaho at the summer solstice at camp Whatafookie if you’d like to join us.  We get naked, paint ourselves blue, take peyote and dance a shamanistic jig to the Earth Goddess. But, that’s another story.  Today I’ve got a great interview with Anne Audain.  She’s a native New Zealander who lives it the US now.  She connected to me on FaceBook and when I started reading her bio I was a bit ashamed to have never met her before.  She competed in the 70’s and 80’s at a very high level as part of that great diaspora of New Zealand runners.  She has a great story.  A real hero’s journey.  You are going to love the stories. It’s a great interview.  If you know someone I should interview let me know.  The rule is - something interesting.  Something you’re curious about.  Something you want to learn more about.  Famous is not a requirement.  I tend to shy away from famous because they are jaded with interviews and give you the pre-recorded schtick.   I I’ve always liked the person-in-the-trenches interviews because they are relatable and applicable to our tribe.  In section one I’m going to talk about training your dog to run with you – because I have a dog I am currently training and I had multiple people ask me about this.  In section two we are going to do some tracking in the New England snow.  Here we are with the first podcast of 2020.  A new year.  A new decade.  You can thank the Romans for this fascination with increments of 10.  It’s not hard to see how they came up with that system based on counting on your fingers.  But, before the Greeks and Romans counted on their fingers there were other, earlier cultures that counted on their fingers and the knuckles of their fingers to come up with a 12 based system.  That still lingers in our world as dozens and grosses.  I’ve started training again.  I don’t have anything specific on the calendar yet.  But it feels good to start getting stronger again after taking a break for the holiday season. I put on about 10 pounds but I’m not worried about it.  It synchs well with the periodicity of my training cycles.  Now, in the beginning of the cycle we focus on strength and aerobic fitness.  There’s no pace work or specific, goal based workouts – so I can carry a couple extra pounds. As long as I feel healthy and eat clean it’s all good and one less thing to stress about.  I find that the weight will take care of itself as the training intensifies closer to the goal event and it’s counter productive to stress on that too early in a cycle.  And what are my events and plans?  We’ll just have to save that for the outro.  But, it’s a new year.  A time of rebirth.  I usually don’t like to go to deep into my personal business, but this story fits well with the new year theme.  I start a new job next week. I’m excited and apprehensive.  Looking forward to it.  It’s a bit of a change for me.  It’s a bigger company as opposed to the startups I’ve been working with for the The RunRunLive 4.0 Podcast Episode 4-422 – Robert Moore Boston Back in the Day (Audio: link) audio:http://www.RunRunLive.com/PodcastEpisodes/epi4422.mp3] Link  MarathonBQ – How to Qualify for the Boston Marathon in 14 Weeks -  Hello and welcome to episode 4-422 of the RunRunLive Podcast.    Merry Christmas, happy Hanukah and happy New Year.  I hope you’re having a great holiday season, if that’s part of your story. Today we talk with Bob Moore who is a guy who raced back in the 70’s, coming in 5th and 7th and 7th at Boston back when it was an entirely different thing to run a marathon.  With folks like Bob I just ask a couple open ended questions and let them go.  I think that’s something we can practice during these holidays when you might be speaking with people you’ve haven’t seen for a while.  Remember, how much joy they get from telling their story and practice active listening.  It’s a gift for them and for you.  In section one I’m going to counsel you on how to cheap out on your winter running gear because anyone who has run with me knows how cheap I am!  In section two I’m going to talk about how to turn worry about a big event or deadline into a positive force.  My running has been going well.  I’m still in hibernation mode.  I try to get out for a mile or so walk with Ollie as part of my morning routine and find that helps him and me start the day well.  I’m still running 4 days a week.  Tuesday and Thursday I get out for 8-9 road miles at a zone 2 effort.  I’ve got a nice, mostly back-road loop that I can run at night with getting run over and I find it quite comforting.  Then on Friday I try to get out during the day with Ollie in the trails for another 10k or.  The trails are frozen and you can’t go fast, but again it is good for him and I to get out.  I mix up it up.  Mostly off leash, even though he’s very jumpy and exuberant with people.  He won’t attack or be mean, but he can be overwhelmingly friendly.   I’ve got a 50/50 chance of getting him to come when called to get back on leash.  I also run him on leash and he’s pretty good with that.  Once he tires out a bit and stopped trying to pull me like it’s the Iditarod.  Sometimes I’ll drop the leash and let it drag.  Buddy figured how to run with the leash dragging between his legs and not step on it.  Ollie hasn’t figured that out.  When I drop the leash he picks it up in his mouth and runs with it.  It’s super cute.  He’s still growing like a weed.  I’ve found a new trainer and I’m going to do some focused work over the next couple weeks before I start my new job.  My wife bought a bunch of stuff from Sears because she had a gift card she needed to use up before they go out of business.  It all showed up at the house in packages and boxes.  I was wrapping presents for Christmas and offered to wrap all these for her as well. She of course, said yes, and even had me wrapping my own presents.  Since I now was in charge I wrapped and labeled the gifts appropriately with the recipients name.  But for my own gifts, that she had bought for me, and now was having me wrap for her I didn’t put my name on them.  I labeled them “Sexy”.  So on Christmas morning when my kids were passing sorting through the gifts they had to ask, “Who’s Sexy?” To which I replied “I am!”  And there you have it.  You are responsible for your own narrative.  When someone gives you a chance to tell your own story, make it a good story.    On with the show, … I’ll remind you that the RunRunLive podcast is ad free and listener supported.  What does that mean? It means you don’t have to listen to me trying to sound sincere about Stamps.com or Audible.. (although, fyi, my MarathonBQ book is on audible) We do have a membership option where you can become a member and as a special t The RunRunLive 4.0 Podcast Episode 4-421 – Coach Talk About the Off Season (Audio: link) audio:http://www.RunRunLive.com/PodcastEpisodes/epi4421.mp3] Link  MarathonBQ – How to Qualify for the Boston Marathon in 14 Weeks -  Hello and welcome to episode 4-421 of the RunRunLive Podcast.    Today we have a good show for you – I talk to the coach about how to manage the off-season which is what most athletes treat this time of year as.  Good practical stuff. In section one I’m going to review the science / opinion on fasting and how it interacts with endurance sports.  In section two I’m going to talk about how to actively cultivate peacefulness – because I think it’s a message we need to hear this time of year.  We are also going to talk about testicles or the lack thereof.  Because that’s just where I am in the never-ending carnival that is daily life.  Ollie the collie is doing well.  He had surgery on Monday and is officially neutered.  You would think that would slow him down.  It did for about a day but he is quickly back to his maniac ways.  I’ve been hunting around now for our next training opportunity.  He’s a great, smart, athletic boy but I need him to learn some simple stuff – like come when called or we are both going to get in trouble.  He also loves to destroy anything laying around the house if we’re not watching.  And, he’s very mouthy.  He loves the taste of human flesh.  I mean, who doesn’t?  But it can get annoying, especially in mixed company.  When I was at the vet this week for the ‘adjustment’ I asked for recommendations on training.  They gave me a contact that they highly recommended.  I conversed with this trainer.  Their program was to take the dog for 3 weeks and deliver him back fully trained.  No muss, no fuss.  Sounds good, right?   They just show up 3 weeks later and hand you the keys to the car.  The only problem I had was that they want $3500 for the process, which I’m sure is quite reasonable, but above my price bracket.  Clearly, I’m becoming that old guy who expects everything to cost a quarter.  We are going to another consultation with a trainer today and we’ll see where that goes.  Another funny story is when I try to do yoga or core work Ollie thinks this is a great opportunity to wrestle on the floor with me.  It’s impossible. It’s funny, but it’s impossible.  Again, who doesn’t’ love a good wrestle on the floor?  Continuing our theme of testicles, I had a fairly hilarious sponsorship opportunity this week.  I got an email from one of those outfits that is trying to make money off podcasts by aggregating niche shows like mine and selling them as a package to sponsors.  This story might be considered a bit PG-13 so you’ve been warned.  Now, I don’t do sponsorship in general, because a) I hate commercials in my podcasts with the burning hate of a thousand suns and b) I just don’t have enough downloads to move the needle money wise.  I mean it would be hatefully annoying to you folks, a big hassle for me all for something like $20 a month.  But the example sponsor they held out to me as attractive commercial bait was a company called Manscaped.  Intrigued I looked them up and yes, they are a new company offering everything you need to create lovely topiaries in your nether regions.  Which is a bit amusing, but the names of their products had both my wife and I howling with laughter.  Their main product is an electric shaver called, wait for it, ‘The Lawn Mower’.   A body wash called ‘The Crop Cleanser’, a hydrating toner called ‘Crop Reviver’ , subtitled ‘Ball Toner’ and an anti-chafing product called ‘Ball Deodorant’.  And the website copy is just a delight to read. So there you go.  A gift for the man who has everything… and they didn’t even have to pay me.  On with th The RunRunLive 4.0 Podcast Episode 4-420 – Kicksology (Audio: link) audio:http://www.RunRunLive.com/PodcastEpisodes/epi4420.mp3] Link  MarathonBQ – How to Qualify for the Boston Marathon in 14 Weeks -  Hello and welcome to episode 4-420 of the RunRunLive Podcast.    It is the week of Thanksgiving up here in New England.  We haven’t gotten any snow yet at my house.  The trails are very runnable. Ollie the Collie and I are getting out 2-3 times a week.  He’s still a menace.  I won’t be able to get away with the ‘Oh, sorry, he’s just a puppy…’ line much longer.  He’ll knock out 8 to 10 miles easy with me in the trails.  I like to let him off leash so he can burn some energy.  It’s takes about 4 ½ miles for him to settle down.  Until that point he’s sprinting up and down the trail.  It’s a challenge because he has no manners and won’t come when he’s called and just loves to meet and greet people we run into.  He’s got another gear now and when he goes, I can’t catch him.  I’ve started referring to him as the ‘monochrome menace’.  But he’s a good runner and he minds well when he’s on leash.  He’ll be a good partner but I’m going to have to break him, like a wild stallion.  He’ll be my .   (Editor’s note: all classical references will be linked to Wikipedia in the show notes) Today we have a good show for you.  Yeah you.  You know who you are.  But first an advertisement for a new cologne that I’m producing for the holidays.  It’s called RunRunLive and it is the pleasing scent of sweat and dog ass.  Buy yours today at the RunRunLive web store.  Comes in a 16-ounce pop-top tall boy.  Today we chat with Brian Metzler about his new book Kicksology which is all about the evolution and lore of the running shoe.  Brian is a veteran running journalist.  Chances are you’ve read something that Brian has created or touched.  He has been a frequent contributor and started or edited a few of your favorite running publications.     What I liked about the book was that it was a trip down memory lane for me.  We love our shoes.  We have an irrational passion for a good pair of shoes.   Brian does a good job of tapping into that. In section one we are going to talk about breathing.  In section two we’re going to talk about memory and redemption.  Since we last talked, you and I, I went for my annual check up.  Apparently, I’m still healthy.  I’ve been working hard on overeating and drinking too much beer for a couple months.  I’m up 8-10 pounds, but it’s part of my natural cycle.  I can already feel the tug of the pendulum in the other direction. I have some good news for you men.  They have determined that the manual test for prostate problems has no efficacy.  No more fingers up the poop chute.  My doctor was reflective.  He said of all the hundreds of these tests he’s done he only ever found 6 anomalies and none of those turned out to be actual problems.  Thanks again to Peter for reading that piriformis bit into audio last episode.  I got some great feedback on that.  I told you I’m trying to make November the month of gratitude.  I have so much to be thankful for.  I’ve been trying to get my morning routine in line by meditating a bit.  I’m going to share a technique I learned that might help you in this season of thanks giving. This is apropos given that we will be talking about breathing next.  Here’s the technique, and you can do this while you’re meditating, or running or sitting in the car.  Inhale gratitude.  Exhale that gratitude out into the world.  On with the show. … I’ll remind you that the RunRunLive podcast is ad free and listener supported.  What does that mean? It means you don’t have to listen to me trying to sound sincere about Stamps.com or Audible.. (although, fyi, my MarathonBQ book The RunRunLive 4.0 Podcast Episode 4-419 – Dawn’s Wisdom (Audio: link) audio:http://www.RunRunLive.com/PodcastEpisodes/epi4419.mp3] Link  MarathonBQ – How to Qualify for the Boston Marathon in 14 Weeks -  Hello and welcome to episode 4-419 of the RunRunLive Podcast.  So – I’m a week late with this one, but it’s great show.  Think about it this way – we gave it an additional week to marinate, to grow, to rise like rustic bread or age like fine wine.  Last week I was all lined up to get the show out for Friday. Thursday was my birthday.  I took Thursday and Friday off from work to recuperate a bit and was working on the show.   Then, ironically as I was writing the hero’s journey piece that is in section two, that talks about how life is not a straight line, and it seldom goes as you expect it to, my old computer ceased to turn on.  I’ve had this Microsoft surface since at least 2015 and it’s been the best computer I ever.  It was powerful enough to do all the audio editing for the show, it has a great form factor for traveling.  Just a great machine that matches my need.  End of this story is that I spent all day Friday in the Microsoft store and ended up buying a new surface that I am happily tapping away on now.  I didn’t loose any data, just some time – and oh by the way – I’m about $2,000 lighter so you might want to consider becoming a member of the RunRunLive Podcast to help defray unexpected expenses.  So with that excuse out of the way let me take you back to the primordial jungles of North America where strange and dangerous beasts roam dark, dank forests…. (Fade in Jungle music) Our old friend Peter Herridge everyone with that excellent dramatic reading.  That piece of writing has been kicking around in my head or a few years.  Probably since I first heard the word ‘piriformis’ and thought, that sounds like the name of a nasty dinosaur.  I immediately thought of Peter who has such a great voice.  Peter was a good runner in his day and one of the original podcasters from a decade ago when we all got online and met each other.  Peter does a podcast every once in a while called ‘spikes’. Today we have a really good, timely chat with Dawn.  I have been following Dawn for a few years but never had her on the show.  She is a heavy social media poster and for some reason I see her posts on LinkedIn a lot.  I have always treated LinkedIn as a professional network and haven’t let this ‘hobby’ side of my life bleed over into it.  She stands out, because you’ve got all these businesspeople talking about business stuff and then there’s Dawn talking about empowerment and Joy.  This time of year, in the northern hemisphere anyhow, we all get stressed out.  The weather turns.  The days get shorter.  If you have kids their schedule ramps up.  It’s budget-setting time and trade show season at your work.  The end of the year is approaching with holidays and deadlines and sales quotas.  It tends to push people into anxiety and depression.  I was there myself this month.  With my work having challenges, me getting older and an unruly puppy to train.  Things just felt awful and closed in and trapped.  My mind started repeating a scarcity narrative of how much I don’t have and how much I’ve lost.  Which, I know is ridiculous, because I’m one of the most blessed and lucky people you’ll ever meet, but that’s how your brain works, especially this time of year. Then I stumbled across one of Dawn’s posts talking about gratitude and abundance.  By the way, one of the symptoms of this downward-spiraling mental malaise is you start trying to distract yourself online.  Whether it’s FB scrolling or too much news or video games.  That’s a bad way to avoid life.  Anyhow, I took a deep breath and declared November a month of gratitude.  In section o The RunRunLive 4.0 Podcast Episode 4-418 – Matt’s Long Ride (Audio: link) audio:http://www.RunRunLive.com/PodcastEpisodes/epi4418.mp3] Link  MarathonBQ – How to Qualify for the Boston Marathon in 14 Weeks -  Hello and welcome to episode 4-418 of the RunRunLive Podcast.  It’s been a busy couple of weeks since we last talked.  I did jump on the Ferry out of Hyannis to Nantucket for that half marathon.  It was kind of fun but also a bit of a struggle.  When I first signed up for it, I thought it would be a fun outing.  Maybe take my wife along or some of my running buddies.  In the end it was just me.  I met up with the other pacers on the ferry and met some nice people in the race.  It was a nice sunny day.  It was a pretty big race considering it was out on an island.  This race fell a week before my target race, the BayState Marathon, and I planned to use it just as a final easy run.  That was the plan.  With how inconsistent my training has been this summer I wasn’t feeling very excited about it.  I offered to run the 2:00 pace group, but they had a greater need for the 1:50 and I acquiesced.  I don’t run a lot of ½ marathons, and my math gets fuzzy.  A 1:50 half is the equivalent of a 3:40ish full marathon, and while not super challenging for where I am right now, it wouldn’t be the lark that a 2:00 would.  It works out to a 8:23 ish pace versus a 9:09 pace.  I went in tired.  My week was weird and my tempo run slipped to Friday, which was probably too close to the race.  My whatever-it-is pain in my butt wasn’t helped by the long ride down to the Cape.  I made the morning ferry with no issues and had no issues finding the pace team at the start. I lost my pace group early.  The first part of the course is a lot of sand roads.  They had had a storm for the previous couple days before the race that dumped a lot of rain and left numerous large puddles straddling the road side-to-side.  It turned those early sections into a bit of a steeplechase.  As a pacer I’m supposed to maintain pace no matter what – so I did and lost everyone who was trying to keep up with me.  I was trying to run by the overall average pace on my watch.  Which was a mistake.  I figured if my overall average was an 8:22 – 8:23 I’d be right on that 1:50 finishing time.  I ended up right on an 8:23.  I slowed down a little at the end because I was all alone and thought I might be a bit too fast.  That turned out to be the mistake and I crossed about 30 seconds too slow – which is a cardinal sin in the pacing biz.  I’ll probably get excommunicated.  Pacing isn’t as easy as it sounds.  Even though my average pace was exactly where it needed to be based on my watch, I missed the clock time.  It’s a bit befuddling.  My watch is always off a little on the distance and I guess that could be worth 30 seconds.  It looks like the only strategy that works is to have your mile splits written out, hard copy and check every mile – old school pacing.  And then plan to be a minute early on top of that to make up for variability.  I got it done, but I didn’t feel great.  Another small racing failure in what has been several months of disconsolate results and discontent.  My whatever-it-is pain in my butt was screaming in the car-ride home.  I was in a bit of a blue mood rolling into the last week of taper for BayState.  And that, my friends is what we will talk about in section one!  In our interview today we talk with Matt about his recent experience of riding his bike unsupported across the TransAm route and then writing about it.  In section two I’m going to rant a little on the current ‘hustle’ culture.  As I was lined up in the starting corral in Lowell, the city of my birth, a city that I have some history with.  I had one of those pure moments that I love about racing.  When yo"

Always consult your physician before beginning any exercise program. The vast majority of people embark on a health, fitness, or nutrition journey to create physical changes in their appearance or health. What is often neglected is that the physical outcomes follow the internal physiological workings. We manage our physiology through our habits, we manage our mindset &amp; brain through our perceptions (arguably this also impacts our physiology as the hypothalamus governs integral components of human metabolism). Only then can we begin to permanently shape our physical selves (the emphasis being on “permanently”, not quick-fix 30- day changes).

I have no idea, but I'll ask others about their routine and struggles, I'll share what I've gone through in trying to remain in shape, as well as food/workouts and music/book/podcast suggestions to potentially help you as you keep driving towards your goals. Whether you decide to go Keto or just low carb, you have to prepare for the pitfalls and temptations. 

Whatever you decide, stick with it and bring someone that can support you along for the ride.

Caution: Not for the easily offended and or grossed out

Music-I mentioned it already but I gotta say it again, Logics new Album, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is SICK! Ill move on after I've played out all the songs...

And finally, my suggestion for your personal vibe-Get rid of your old smelly Running/Workout gear like, yesterday. 

Thanks for listening.

Stay Savage. Today we hear from a man simply know as Ben. 

He loves running, he loves the outdoors, and he loves his family. Listen in as he tells us why...

As always, thanks for listening. Question: Should you fuel with Caffeine before your workout?

Answer: YAS!

While I didn't make a suggestion for anything on the episode I would suggest listening to the new Logic album, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. More specifically listen to Keanu Reeves and Limitless when you start your workout. Regardless if you like Hip Hop or not, Logic works through a lot of genres and takes you on incredible journey with very thematic and dramatic story telling. I slept on him for years and now Im hooked!

Stay Savage! After knocking out a quick 10er on my fixed gear, Steve Rogers, I thought I would share my thoughts as well as others opinions on the benefits and or dangers of riding a fixed gear bike.

Say Watt?,"Since 1982 Rick Zwetsch, a lifelong cyclist, has been a fan of Race Across America and the ultra-cyclists who take on this grueling ride – touted as the world’s toughest bike race. After being asked many times over the years if he would ever attempt it… one day, at age 60, he surprised himself—and his partner Caryn Capriccioso—by saying “yes!” How does an avid, but recreational cyclist go from seasonal hobby to tackling a 3,000 mile, 12-day ride only completed by 13 people over the age of 60 in its 38-year history? What does it take for a Colorado couple with an already (overly) full life to integrate the learning training, planning, qualifying races, and necessary crew development? Ride along as Rick and Caryn share the ins and outs, ups and downs, and highs and lows of their journey. On route they will talk with others who have attempted Race Across America, their crews, race owners, officials, media, and the many people who are an integral part of the ultra-cycling community. Can he do it? Will he make it? What will it take for Rick to join the ranks of the few, the proud, the RAAM-finishers in June of 2021? At the end of the day, is it really about the race, or is it the journey that matters most? Join us for the first of our shorter, more concise episodes where we get laser focused on one subject! As we’ve been recording each episode, thinking about future episodes and well just talking about this stuff amongst ourselves and with others we realized there are a LOT of exercise, training and racing acronyms and terms that some listening may not be familiar with. Certainly, cyclists and ultra-cyclists will be in the know but others new to cycling or family and friends may be scratching their heads thinking, what the heck are all these terms and acronyms they’re using? Listen in and we’ll explain some of what we’re talking about!

Brandy also shares the inside scoop on planning for and crewing RAW including things to consider, what makes a crew work, her thoughts on budgeting and fundraising, and why she dedicates her and her family’s time to Jason’s cycling pursuits. This is a must listen for aspiring and even experience crew members. Athletes, listen in, too…you’re bound to gain a better understanding of what your crew goes through while you’re pedaling away toward your goals.

 Race Across America: https://www.raceacrossamerica.org/ Jen Orr is an accomplished triathlete turned ultra-cyclist. She made the switch with a bang taking first place overall (female) solo and setting a course record at the 2018 6-12-24 Hour World Time Trial Championships and leading the way to first place overall (male or female) solo in 2019 Race Across the West (RAW). Rick and Jen served together on Seana Hogan’s 2018 record-setting Race Across America (RAAM) crew wanting to see what it takes to get an athlete across the country and to the finish line as they both contemplated future RAW and RAAM attempts.
 How (and why) did Jen make the shift to ultra-cycling? What makes her successful? What challenges does she face? What advice does she have for Rick as he stares down 5.5 months to his RAW attempt and what is she thinking about as she prepares for RAAM this June? Ride along as Rick and Jen discuss these topics and more in this engaging and inspiring interview.

They chat about Marko’s storied cycling and coaching career, how he decided to take on Rick (a 60+, rookie ultra-cyclist) as a client, his hopes/expectations for his clients, and where he’ll be racing in 2020. Like Rick and Caryn, Marko and his wife, Irma, balance the worlds of ultra-cyclist and support crew, and he talks about the role of this relationship in his and any ultra-cyclists’ success. Now that Rick is freshly qualified for Race Across America, and plans to race it in June of 2021, how will he spend the next year and a half? Caryn and Rick will talk through his big picture plans for 2020 including races, training, planning and raising money for RAAM—and how to fit all of this into their already full lives. In the episode’s “Everyday Item,” we’ll share how you can learn more about ultra-cycling races and get involved in this endurance community.   While Rick’s on the course turning his pedals, the crew is working behind the scenes to make sure everything’s on track, anticipating Rick’s needs and trying to take care of our own. In this episode, we’ll share Caryn’s race report, and talk with crewmate, Dan Pfister who has a unique perspective as a first-time crew member and long-time cycling friend."

Science Of Ultra,"For endurance athletes who want to do more than improve race performance. Learn how to eat, sleep, think, and move better. Become your ultra best! Cramping isn't well understood. But here's what we know right now. Rest days are a staple of most running programs. But are they needed. In this episode we reframe our view of exercise, rest, and recovery time to help you make clearer decisions about when you exercise. A T/F from each of our four coaches posed to the group to wrap up 2019. Does level running speed translate to uphill abilities, is training for a 200 miler fundamentally different from training for shorter distances, should you run through tweaks or injuries, is more running volume going to help you run 100-milers better...these are our main topics of conversation. The main goals of this episode are to shed light on the origins of zone training, illustrate how the borrowing of the models by athletes is flawed especially when heart rate is used as the primary indicator, anchor a 3-zone model to training-relevant physiology, indicate the conceptual utility of a 5-zone model, and provide you with a general guide for distributing your training intensity volumes. Full script at https://scienceofultra.com/podcasts/112 Our four coaches present a variety of ideas and perspectives on taking time off.

After a long hiatus, I explain why I'm bringing this project back to life - and how we can all benefit from this short podcast. This episode is just a short ""re-introduction"" to the Scientific Strength podcast. In this episode of Scientific Strength, we'll look at a new study comparing conventional straight bar deadlifts to hexagonal bar deadlifts. There's very limited research with this comparison, so this exciting new study sheds light on some of the key differences that are important to understand.  The Scientific Strength Podcast is back! This week we'll discuss an interesting study comparing a bodybuilding training regimen to a powerlifting regimen to evaluate muscular adaptations in well trained men. When volume is equal - is one approach better? We'll discuss in Episode 19.  There is a SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT in this week's show, so be sure to take a quick listen about the future of Scientific Strength. We also discuss a landmark study about the health consequences of prolonged sitting. Is sitting the new smoking? We'll discuss this week on the show. This week's show we'll cover a very simple and important functional test to assess general strength and mobility. Learn why this test is important and how we use it as a part of the functional performance process. This week on Scientific Strength. "

Scott Abel Fitness Podcast,"Learn about nutrition and training, muscle gain and fat loss. Be more consistent with better habits and mindset, plus learn the real-world fitness strategies and principles that have stood the test of time. Ignore the come-and-go trends, and focus on proven strategies that work. Scott talks with Dotsie Bausch, a seven-time USA cycling champion and a medal-winning athlete with team USA's cycling team. Dotsie was named by VegNews in 2019 as one of the top 20 most influential vegans in the world. She was featured in the 2017 documentary The Game Changers and the 2015 documentary, Personal Gold An Underdog Story.



 

Topics Covered



* The spiritual element of training and health, and its relation to sustainability and success in training and health;

* The ways in which the end-goals themselves are not what'll make you happy;

* Dotsie's training and health regimen now, which is very relaxed and includes mountain biking, yoga, and power walking;

* Dotsie's movement towards plant-based nutrition;

* The corporate influence on a lot of health studies and the myths it creates (e.g., chocolate milk for recovery);

* The food industry and its horrific treatment of animals;

* The so-called “debunking” of The Game Changers, and James Wilk's response on Joe Rogan.



 

Dotsie's TED Talk, Olympic Level Compassion



 

Links Mentioned



* Dotsie's Website Bio

* Switch4Good website

* Personal Gold: An Underdog Story (2015)

* The Game Changers (2018) Scott and Mike discuss what to do when you struggle with cravings. So, you open the bag, and find you just can't stop until the whole bag's finished; or, you try to have a handful, but you then need to reach for more.

 

Topics covered



* The importance of wondering “what if?” I.e., if you're always thinking “mmm, oh, should I or shouldn't I?” then even if you don't snack then and there, the fact that you're constantly wondering is going to drain you, and at some point you will. The goal is to get to the point where you don't even thinking about it.

* You want to find a way to incorporate bright lines. So for example, don't just eat roughly half the bag from the bag; instead, pour out the portion you need, then put the bag away. Then, once you've finished the amount, that's it. It's clear.

* The difficulty of taking response-ability without wrapping it up with blame game connotations that do come wrapped up with the concept of “responsibility.”

* The importance of who you want to be and how that influences your decisions and habits.

* How to deal with this stuff by spending only a bit of time analyzing the problem, and then shifting the focus to what you can do about the problem.

* The use of implementation intentions (“if this, then that”-type plans to deal with challenges) to help cut off the “oh what the hell” thoughts after a minor screw-up. This episode was based on a coaching client email Scott received that indicated what progress looks like. It's not just a before and after photo. It's about letting go of JOMO, not worrying at all about the scale, not being shamed based on what the weight scale says, and things like that.

Most of the discussion was about unpacking the hows and whys of these four main indicators of progress from the email:



1. the writer understands that worrying about the 0.4 lbs on the weight scale was silly, and that what [popular diet program] was doing was actually wrong and damaging;

2. they understand the corollary to the first point, i.e., that losing too much scale weight can actually be bad and lead to rebounds;

3. they don’t experience JOMO;

4. they seem to enjoy their plan and feel as though they’re in a good place. How do you start a program off on the right foot? If you've tried multiple diets and “failed” in the past, and you still, y'know, have weight to lose, how do you actually change things so that this time it really is different, and you're not just doing different versions of the same thing, over and over again?

This episode was all about how to do that, and how to start a new diet or program off on the right foot, in a way that you'll actually make a real change.

Some key themes:



* Focus on strength and what you want to move towards, instead of fear and what you're trying to avoid.

* Consistency builds confidence…  Consistency plus confidence builds competence… and consistency plus confidence plus competence builds a sustainable lifestyle without struggle!

* Create a strong enough “why.”



Beyond these, Scott and Mike offered 3 ideas each for creating an actual, substantial shift in your approach:

Mike's 3 ideas:



* Stop, pause, and carve out the time (i.e. book it in your calendar) to deal with some of the stuff we talked about. (This will also help wit hthe next two ideas.)

* Grab a journal and write some of this stuff down. If you're thinking about change, write out how not changing has hurt you in the past, how it is hurting you in the present, and how — if you continue to not change — it'll hurt you in the future. Now do the same for if you do change. What benefits will you enjoy 5 years from now? 10 years from now? (Etc.). (Pssst: See also Mike's Book on Journaling.)

* Figure out specific implementation intentions (and write them down). These are “if/then” scenarios. For example, *if* you get caught in a meeting, what will you do? What's your if this happens, then I will do this strategy?



Scott's 3 ideas:



* Figure out powerful clichés that you can turn back to when things get challenging. Scott's example was telling himself “a champion wouldn't do _______” whenever he was tempted to do something he knew didn't serve his goals (e.g., take the bus instead of talking home with his groceries).

* Try the “and then what?” journaling exercise. Write out your goal and pretend you achieved it. Now ask, “and then what?” Write the answer down. Then write “and then what?” again, and answer again. Keep going for a total of five times.

* Embrace that you can either be a person of your own power and style or you can be a person of your own fears and impotence.



Closing idea: Have fun!  Don't make it harder than it needs to be. Figure out ways to enjoy the journey. Unrealistic images of bodies. Supplements. Mental and emotional issues. Orthorexia.

Is the fitness industry actually doing “good” in the world?

Most experts or companies will frame fitness as “empowering” and “healthy,” even when the effects of their messages are anything but empowering or healthy.

 

In this episode:



* Mike's ambivalent feelings towards marketing and the fitness industry.

* The ways in which negative or damaging ideas can be couched in very “positive” and “empowering” messages.

* Scott's experiences with the shady things the supplement industry has done in the past. This topic came from Mike. The idea of Cornerstone Concepts came from a similar idea in pedagogy studies about threshold concepts. The idea with these is that once a student understands a given concept like this, it completely changes their understanding of a topic, and/or their ability to understand that topic. The student immediately starts making new connections, other things start to fall into place etc. Things just “click.” They re-frame what the student already knows.

For today's episode, we came up with 5 ½ cornerstone concepts to go through:



* Concept 1. Biofeedback and inside/out vs. outside/in

* Concept 2. A concept I’m calling “the broad strokes”

* Concept 3A. Train the muscle not the movement and it’s the muscles that work the weights, not the weights that work the muscles

* Concept 3B. Train for development and strength will come, not the other way around.

* Concept 4. Metabolism as the sum total of all the chemical processes in the body (not just calories in/calories out)

* Concept 5. Calorie burning vs. calorie investing



Other notes:



* Scott mentioned this study: Between-meal Energy Intake Effects On Body Composition, Performance And Total Caloric Consumption In Athletes

* Shout-out and thanks to Stu from Home Studio Basics for emailing his experience with training the muscle, not the movement.

* Mike and Scott debated meal frequency. Scott mentioned studies that support higher meal frequency, but Mike remains unconvinced, as he's seen studies support both higher and lower meal frequency.



Meal frequency studies Scott mentioned (suggesting increased frequency is good):



* Effects of meal frequency on body composition during weight control in boxers

* Effect of Meal Frequency and Timing on Physical Performance



Meal frequency studies Mike's seen that complicate this:



* The influence of higher protein intake and greater eating frequency on appetite control in overweight and obese men.

* Meal frequency and energy balance

* Increased meal frequency does not promote greater weight loss in subjects who were prescribed an 8-week equi-energetic energy-restricted diet.



Studies emphasizing meal-timing regularity:



* Beneficial Metabolic Effects of Regular Meal Frequency on Dietary Thermogenesis, Insulin Sensitivity, and Fasting Lipid Profiles in Healthy Obese Women

* Regular meal frequency creates more appropriate insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles compared with irregular meal frequency in healthy lean women.

* Decreased thermic effect of food after an irregular compared with a regular meal pattern in healthy lean women

* Stomach ghrelin-secreting cells as food-entrainable circadian clocks.

 Welcome to the Sensory Strides podcast.  Observations of the world through activity, reading, listening, and everything else.
 Saturday was race day!  The day started clear and cool.  As the day went on, the sun came out.  It was a great day to be on the trails.  I felt God’s love shining done.
 Those trails were muddy though!  There were places where when you stepped in the mud your foot just sunk, but most of the mud was the kind where you step, and your foot just slides sideways.  That kind of mud really tests your balance.  I was very glad I had been training with hiking poles and had them with me.  I’m not sure how some of the others made it up the hills especially without poles.  Those hills are steep enough without mud – with the mud it takes your whole body to climb.  All the slip and sliding really added a whole new element.  It hadn’t been that muddy all summer while I had been training.
 Talking about climbing – there was 8,871 feet of climb. Since we start and end at the same place, that means we had that much downhill too.  However, there was one section where we dropped about 900 ft in just over a tenth of a mile.  It was towards the later part of the race and my feet were not happy holding the rest of my body back at that point.
 I was so appreciative to have an amazing crew following me.  My daughter, husband, mom, and dad followed me all day long.  They allowed me to drop my poles on the road segments and meant that I only had to carry my water bladder on the longer trail segments.  Not having to worry about having that backpack the whole time allowed me to relax my shoulders and back, use my arms to gain some speed on the road sections, and just created a much more enjoyable experience.  Plus, I didn’t have to carry food or refill my water myself.  Yeah team!
 My A goal was 9 hours – the time the race director stated was the cutoff, my B goal was to finish.  Before the race, the director said that because of the mud the cutoff time would be extended.  In some ways I wish I hadn’t known that so that I would have pushed myself harder.
 When I was about 4 miles in, a racer came up behind me, super-fast.  He was a marathon runner that had started a half hour after me.  Soon enough the rest of the marathoners passed me.  When I was about 8 miles in, he passed me again on his way back.  THAT made me feel really slow!  I didn’t see any of the other runners on their way back in.  However, about mile 18 another runner came up behind me.  He was doing the 50k but had taken a wrong turn and added about 4 ½ miles to his course.  At about mile 23, where there was a fuel station, I saw him sitting there.  He decided not to finish.  I encouraged him to continue, but he was out of his fuel and was going to take the SAG wagon back to the finish. My family ended up taking him back instead and had a really nice conversation with him.
 The first 2/3rd’s of the race I was just about perfect with the times – just behind the 6-hour mark.  However, the mud in the last quarter of the race kicked my butt and the steep downhills sealed the deal.  During the last two miles I just kept talking to myself to get myself through it.  I climbed what I thought was the final hill (where I could see the finish line).  However, there were three more down and up and more mud.  By the last mile or so I decided to throw the time goals away and just focus on finishing.  My toes were done.  Every step that had the slightest downhill was so painful.  My legs and the rest of my body felt fine, but you really need your toes for balance.  My entire being was focused on the finish.  The property we were on was beautiful.  I was gingerly trekk ""A walk in nature walks the soul back home.""       - Andy Rooney
 Final long run (well kind of) before tapering. 22 miles on the trails.  Instead of using the same trails I’ve been on all summer, I decided to hit some of the trails at the park which I haven’t been on before.  Last weekend my family went to the park to find some geocaches we hadn’t found yet.  It was a good activity to keep the younger group busy and allow the older group to get out in nature and do an activity we enjoy – while getting some additional caches.
 While at Kickapoo Valley Reserve http://kvr.state.wi.us/Home I found out that there is an annual challenge which encourages people to hike all the trails and canoe the river through the park.  After looking at the list of the trails and how they had broken them into segments for the challenge, I realized I had already done over half of them this summer.  Knowing I had 22 miles this week I was able to finish another third of them.  I have just a few shorter segments to finish the hiking portion.  Then – I’ll just have to figure out how to get in a day of canoeing or kayaking on the river to finish the challenge.  I’m not worried about the river but figuring out when to fit it in given how late we are in the season is going to be the challenge.  http://kickapoovalley.wi.gov/Documents/Recreation/KVR%20Trail%20Challenge%20Form.pdf
 I had a whole new experience this week on the trails.  I am so glad that I found this challenge.  I found some new trails that were completely different than the trails I have been training on.  Many of the trails were nice wide, grass paths.  One of them had a boardwalk along a marsh.  I didn’t even know that KVR had a boardwalk anywhere.  Most of the trails at the reserve are single track and narrow.
 I have a few segments yet to finish.  I plan on including them for my 12-mile trail workout this week.  Yep, taper time and I still must do nearly a half marathon.  It sure doesn’t feel like a taper.
 This summer I have started listening to audio books while hiking.  I am enjoying listening to a book better than multiple hours of podcasts.  I still love my podcasts, but while out on the trails, listening to a book is more complementary to the environment than self help or business podcasts.  However, when I am doing my road workouts on the bike trail along the highway, those podcasts feel more appropriate than an audio book.  I’ve been using Libby which is the app libraries use for eBooks and audio books.  I’ve been using it for eBooks to read through the kindle app for a couple of years and I am absolutely loving using it for audio now. https://meet.libbyapp.com/

 Twitter @sensorystrides “What makes your heart sing?”  Carmine Gallo
 I recently read the book Talk Like Ted. 
 One of my passions is working with high school Girl Scouts.  The highest award a high school Girl Scout can earn is the Gold Award.  I am honored to be on our Girl Scout Council’s Gold Award Committee and assist Girl Scouts through the process.  The first two chapters reinforced much of what I tell others about choosing a good Gold Award project. 
 The book is a guide for those making presentations.  It describes why the TED Talk format works so well.  The book is structured so those that aren’t giving a TED Talk can still find valuable tips.  I picked up the book as I have applied to give a TEDx talk next spring and have been thinking about the presentation.  After reading the book I have more confidence and am eager to create a presentation.
 The first chapter talks about passion.  We often talk about identifying your passion when working to choose a Gold Award project.  The book takes this a step further.  I love the question the book presents “What makes your heart sing?” (page 55).  This is about more than passion.  I think of this as “What gets you fired up?”. This is what gets your heart racing.  A subject that when it is brought up in conversation you just cannot keep quiet.  The subject that if your best friend, a stranger, and you were in a conversation and the stranger brought it up, your best friend would just roll her eyes, knowing what is coming.  The train has left the station and there are no brakes.
 The second chapter talks about storytelling.  As I read this chapter, I thought about the interviews related to the Gold Award process.  Often as we go through the Gold Award process, we answer questions as written or follow a checklist.  If instead we used each question as an opportunity to tell a story, project connections would be clearer. The ‘why’ of a project would come across more easily.  Instead of checking requirements off a list, a fuller explanation would be available.
 By sharing the story, the project becomes more personal.  Not only to the review committee, but to others as you ask them to support your project.  The donor, your project advisor, your volunteers.  All of them will better understand your goals when you share your story.
 There are a lot of other interesting pieces regarding presentation in the book.  One I found most interesting was regarding how fast you should speak.  As someone who speaks fast and listens to podcasts at 1.9 speed, the material presented caused me to pay more attention to my speaking speed.  I learned a lot about listening too.
 The presentation tips are valuable for all.  I know it drives me crazy when a presenter reads every word on the slide.  Why do we need a presenter? I could have read the slides myself.  Using the slides to enhance the presentation is a tip many people could learn.

 Twitter @sensorystrides “You are an Ironman!”  Mike Reilly
 I started reading Mike Reilly’s book Finding My Voice.  I was in the car and I think I was crying by the third paragraph.  The stories Mike shares in the book are so emotional.  I think they really inspire me since I want to hear Mike call me an Iron Man someday.
 One of my friends raced Lake Placid Iron Man this summer.  She posted pictures on Facebook with her signed copy of Mike’s book.
 I had heard about the book earlier this year, but it wasn’t in our library yet.  I had forgotten about it until I saw Jenny’s picture.  I looked online and not only did no libraries in our regional system have it, no libraries in the entire state had it.  Well, I knew I had to fix that.  I emailed the librarian (also a good friend) and asked if she would order the book.  She did and now not only do I get to read it, but hopefully it will inspire others in the area.
 There is a story for everyone in here.  Family stories, stories of survival, fighting back from medical issues, military, everything.  I highly recommend everyone ready the book.  I guarantee you will have a new appreciation for Iron Man after doing so.  Who knows, perhaps you’ll decide you want Mike to call you an Iron Man too.

Sebastiano: svegliarsi ogni giorno alle 6 di mattina e studiare

Stefano: studiare per contro proprio 1h al giorno


Appunti interessanti:

Un video che vi spiega l’effetto della caffeina sul vostro corpo: YouTube
Il caffè decaffeinato contiene circa 2-3mg di caffeina. Un espresso ne contiene 120mg circa. Quindi, parliamo di circa il 2-3% di caffeina nel decaffeinato. Vuoi provare a smettere o diminuire le dosi di caffè, contattaci e ti aiuteremo!
Possiamo influenzare positivamente le persone.

Instagram: sfide_settimanali Dopo le vacanze, il rischio maggiore è quello di tornare alla vita di tutti i giorni e perdere le belle abitudini costruite nei mesi prima! Come fare quindi? Un tuffo nel mare gelido, ci aiuterà!
Sfide settimanali:

Sebastiano: scrivere 1.000 parole al giorno per la tesi.

Stefano: riprendere la routine mattutina e fare il bagno nel mare freddo.


Appunti interessanti:

Cercare di uscire dalla zona comfort. Cercare lo “scontro”: la critica che ci fa male, ma che ci può aiutare.
Le sfide possono solo aiutarci a fare un de-click.
FOCUS, concentriamoci su di un obiettivo. Vi consiglio il libro Deep Work.
Essere pro-attivi: è un’attitudine. Ancora una volta: proponiamo, facciamo cose differenti, “pazze”, “strane” (senza esagerare..:P), come fare il bagno nel mare a gennaio.
L’ambiente è molto importante: cercare di essere sempre stimolati, dall’ambiente, dalle persone. Se non abbiamo un ambiente stimolante: cambiamo! Muoviamoci! Cambiamo amici!
La routine e le regole, ci portano ordine nella vita. Nelle vacanze, questo ordine scema un po’: può essere anche utile questa pausa. L’importante è riprendere le buone abitudini appena ripreso il lavoro.

Appunti interessanti:

Il documentario The Game Changers
Trovare dei trucchetti per darci il “biscottino”, il feedback positivo. Come ad esempio il poter leggere i messaggi di Whatsapp e rispondere.
Cerca di prendere in mano la situazione: decidi TU quando leggere le notifiche del telefono per non farti influenzare. FOCUS: vi consiglio il libro Deep Work.
Essere pro-attivi: è un’attitudine.  Anticipare: facciamo oggi quello che possiamo fare domani. Perché domani, sicuramente avremo degli imprevisti. Anticipiamo quindi.

Shattering Limitations,"My entire life it seems I have been overcoming obstacles.

At the age of 6 I almost died in the ER after my appendix burst ad my young body fought off sepsis. On at least 3 occasions since reaching adulthood I have had doctors tell me I should not be alive due to various medical situations. Here I am through, at the age of 41, full of health and confidence and preparing to run a half marathon. Shortly after birth my parents were told I would permanently be in a wheelchair by 21...at 41 I am training to run my first half marathon. This is that story."

There are so many different styles of yoga that it becomes difficult for the practitioners to choose one, let alone the newbies. Not all yoga styles are the same, some styles can appear completely different from the other.

Some yoga enthusiasts like to hop around and learn different styles whereas some like to progress with one or two specific forms of yoga. If you are willing to try a form of yoga that fulfills your physical, mental as well as emotional needs then Iyengar yoga is the most desirable choice."

We stopped eating bread and pasta, and we focused on eating more protein and veggies. This was a tough change for former distance runners, who grew up during the time of carb loading and grains being the base of the food pyramid. How extreme was this change? Let's just say I kept a food diary for my track coach in college and got a thumbs up for having 70% carbs in my diet. Cutting out bread and pasta was a simple move that changed everything.

Jak nie zfiksować na punkcie diety, a także przedstawię moje spojrzenie na branżę fit z perspektywy przeprowadzonych kilkuset godzin treningów personalnych. Cześć! Zdarza Ci się nie wysypiać? W tym odcinku dowiesz się jak doraźnie, radzić sobie z zarwaną nocką. Posłuchasz o tym jaką kolację lepiej jeść przed snem, czym jest ashwagandha, oraz utniemy sobie turbo drzemkę. Pamiętaj jednak, że jest to tylko pomoc doraźna i nie zastąpi prawdziwego mocnego snu. Cześć! W dzisiejszym odcinku mówię o najczęstszych błędach osób rozpoczynających swoją przygodę ze zdrowym trybem życia. Skupiam się bardziej na aspekcie ""psychologicznym"" więc mogą one nie być do końca oczywiste, dlatego tym bardziej zachęcam do słuchania. Cześć!

Wzory o których opowiadam w podcaście:

Podstawowa przemiana materii dla Mężczyzn:
88,362+(13,357xmasa ciałą w kg)+(4,799x wzrost w cm)-(5,677xwiek w latach)

Współczynnik PAL:

1,2 – 1,3 – bezruch np. dla pacjenta chorego leżącego w łóżku
1,4 – dla niskiej aktywności fizycznej (na przykład praca biurowa)
1,6 – dla umiarkowanej aktywności fizycznej 
1,75 – aktywny tryb życia
2 – bardzo aktywny tryb życia (praca fizyczna plus kilka treningów w tygodniu)
2,2-2,4 – wyczynowe uprawianie sportu

Będzie też trochę o krytycznym spojrzeniu wobec ""fit mentorów"". Na koniec podam Ci też schemat który warto żebyś zastosował w trakcie pierwszego miesiąca swoich treningów. Witam Cię w trzecim odcinku mojego podcastu. Na wakacjach lepiej odpoczywać czy trenować? W tym odcinku przedstawię Ci moje spojrzenie na te dwa aspekty. Podpowiem jak możesz aktywnie spędzić czas na wyjeździe. A jeśli jesteś treningowym zapaleńcem, przedstawię jak możesz trenować wykorzystując tylko gumy oporowe.

Trening o którym wspominam na koniec odcinka może wyglądać w taki sposób:

Rozgrzewka:
3 serie: 
0a plank 30""
0b bieg bokserski 20"" (ćwiczenia robisz bez przerwy, od razu po sobie)

Skindeep,"A podcast where you can enjoy conversations around a range of topics that promote healthy lifestyle, self care, healing and growth. Today I speak with a retired detective who investigated the murder of a friend and client of mine, going on to successfully convict her husband for her murder.
Author of “Making of a detective,'' Pat Marry offers an insight into the mind of a psychopath and their personality.
I wish to dedicate this episode to Mary Gough and every woman who had their beautiful life violently ceased by someone they loved &amp; trusted. The tables turn in today’s episode of Skin Deep by Corinna Tolan.
My good friend, Siobhan O’Hagan, hosts today’s episode &amp; has me as her guest. We take you back to the very beginning of my career, how I’ve found working with family. What I attribute my success to &amp; what lessons I’ve learnt. 
Join us for this candid conversation between two friends. I have invited Ireland’s leading psychic medium, Fiona Faery, to join me in conversation today, to offer myself &amp; my listeners some words of comfort as we make peace with grief &amp; loss.
We chat about how her abilities have impacted her everyday life. Her perspective of heaven &amp; hell &amp; why people would choose to exit this life ahead of their time.
My wish is that this beautiful conversation brings you as much comfort
&amp; solace as it brought me.

Setting reminders for yourself can be a useful and simple way to ensure that are consistently checking in with yourself. Also, asking yourself ... Jeff Vernon learned grit and perseverance as a kid in the family business. Those lessons carried him through a series of entrepreneurial successes and brought him where he is today - disrupting the fitness industry with a treadmill that makes you work harder and run better.  In OCR &amp; Crossfit coaches work on perfecting a series of skills training, but overlook proper running form.  Not only to prevent injury but to improve performance! As Joe De Sena says, “performance always wins.” Dr. L says: Life is short. It’s important to get the most out of life that you can and dive into all the adventure and awesomeness that sits at your feet. AND it’s critical that along the way we are weaving in a layer of compassion when things don’t go our way. When we fail, fall short of our goals, or come up short against our expectations, yes, learn from that but also make sure that you are bringing in some humor and not weighing yourself down with criticism.

In this interview she discusses the importance of being vulnerable, challenging yourself, leaning into things that make you feel anxious and how much you can learn from something you’re not good at. ... Dr. L says: It’s important that you are consistently and frequently checking in with yourself, and there are a couple of different areas, in particular, that might need attention. First, checking in with your own emotions is key because in order for you to make the next right choice you need to understand how you are feeling. Second, checking in with how you are feeling about your relationships is important. What are the ways that you feel either connected or disconnected? ...

Sporty,"Sporty is your guide to the powerful place of sport and fitness in Australia’s cultural life. Recognising it’s much more than a game, Sporty charts and analyses big-time spectator sports, celebrates the amateur athlete and encourages anyone struggling to get active. You don’t have to get sport, to get Sporty! Why are a bunch of cricketers doing their training in the local swimming pool?  How did the career of a national league netballer come to a sudden and dramatic end? In both cases: extreme heat. What's it like to be on a motorbike doing close to 400kph? Plus, does stem cell therapy work for sport and exercise injuries? How does doing something physically active help soothe whatever's raging in your head? Everyone's heard of 'muscle memory'. But nobody agrees on what, precisely, it is. Do some people avoid being physically active because they register pain more acutely than others? Learning to swim as an adult isn't easy. How do you overcome a fear of water? And, why is parkrun so popular?"
Stacked with Joe DiStefano,"Stacked was born from the idea that just as our bodies are structurally stacked, as are all of the practices that allow us to be our most optimal selves. Over the years I’ve been witness to so much of the information out there getting listeners and readers excited about what a new idea or product can do for them, without giving credence to the importance of laying a solid foundation. The problem is, without this, our desired outcome won’t be sustainable, if even achievable. On Stacked, wellness experts, high performers and happy, purposeful individuals share the tools they use to build a sustainable foundation and the backstories that often go untold. Aaron Alexander joins me for a chat about easy ways to move toward alignment, how our posture influences our perception both of the world and of ourselves, why emotions affect us physically, and how some of the healthiest people in the world know nothing about health. I sit on the front steps with Chef Pete Evans to talk about his whirlwind adventures in LA, traditional cooking methods, and biohacking for travel. Gil Blander breaks down the science of InsideTracker and gives us a glimpse of what we can expect for 2020. I take a turn on the microphone solo to share five key facets of health and wellness that will change your life this year. I join Pete Evans on H.E.A.L. to talk about exercise and fitness, ancestral roots and diet, and how we become our own worst enemy by complicating what it means to be healthy. Dr. Marchese helped me retrain my brain. We talk about my rehabilitation process, why trap bar deadlifts are a terrible exercise, and a whole lot more."

Stay Healthy South Sound,"On the Stay Healthy South Sound Podcast, we provide tips on staying healthy and expose common myths about health and aging so you can enjoy a healthier and active life in the amazing South Sound. This podcast is brought to you by Dr. Jennifer Penrose owner of Penrose & Associates Physical Therapy. Dr. Jennifer Penrose interviews “Lando” co-owner of CrossFit Cloud City Athletics in Lacey WA.  We discuss Lando’s journey in opening CrossFit after being in the military.  He talks about the myths surrounding CrossFit (even I had some misconceptions of CrossFit!). 

We discuss key concepts of fitness and how the warm-up and cool down and stretching/mobility is key to injury prevention.  Lando loves learning and has a passion for developing solid work out programs.  

The best thing you can do for your health and enjoying life is investing in yourself.  Start somewhere and do one step at a time. Dr. Jennifer Penrose is the owner of Penrose &amp; Associates Physical Therapy and she has created a team that truly “listens” to patients and understands that pain management is a key reason people come to therapy. Dr. Jennifer Penrose interviews local orthopedic surgeon Dr. Richard Lamour.  He specializes in ankle foot surgery and sports medicine at Olympia Orthopedics at their East location on Lilly Rd  His training included dual fellowships: 1. Orthopaedic Sports Medicine Fellowship: Andrews Institute for Orthopaedics &amp; Sports Medicine, Gulf Breeze, FL 2.  Foot and Ankle Surgery Fellowship: Las Vegas Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Institute, Las Vegas, NV. Dr. Jennifer Penrose interviews Dr. Nancy Miller-Ihil to discuss nutrition as a basis for health.  We discuss weight loss, Paleo, Keto, and how genetics influences what some of us can and can’t eat.  Weight loss is more about keeping weight off and the TLS solutions through Nutrametrix offers a free questionnaire that based on your personality, lifestyle, and commitment level will put together a plan for you including recipes. Dr. Jennifer Penrose interviews Hawk Mason, LMT licensed massage therapist who provides massage therapy services at Penrose Physical Therapy.  He is a former military veteran with experience leading a team overseas as well as a history of working with disabled adults.   

We discuss how “massage therapy is a powerful tool that can help you take charge of your health and well-being” quote from the Mayo clinic!  We discuss the benefits that the literature/research has been able to show as well as what we see with clients.  

Massage therapy is no longer considered a “luxury spa service” but more of an integrated approach to wellness and feeling and moving better.  In fact, with today’s social media we are actually becoming more anxious and less connected to community and each other.  Massage is a great way to decrease anxiety and provide healing through touch.  Massage therapy lowers blood pressure, decreases pain, improves mobility and leads to healthier lives!  

People are surprised that their pain is actually referred from somewhere else: called trigger points in the muscles.  It is very common to have tension headaches from neck muscles that send pain to behind your eyes, your temporal region, your face and jaw.  Massage is so helpful with stress, tension, scar tissue after surgeries, and maintaining mobility with arthritis. Dr. Jennifer Penrose interviews Marissa Ang who is an athletic trainer working in Dr. Penrose’s clinic with a very specific role in working with seniors.  We discuss how those 50+ need to have a balanced work out: aerobic, strength, balance exercises, and flexibility.  We discuss how falls are one of the leading causes of injuries and death for those 65+.  Marissa describes some balance tests you can easily test yourself with at home and what to do about it."

Stillpoints: A Podcast with Scott Johnson,"The Stillpoints Podcast with Scott Johnson brings insightful, inspiring and moving conversation to how contemplative practices has landed in our modern culture. Scott talks to the many people who have inspired him over the years, as director of Stillpoint Yoga London, to see how their practices have landed in the world. #011: Joey Miles   ‘This book is to help you sit like a mountain, so that when you see the big mountains you’ll know what to look for’. 
    Scott talks to Joey Miles, an authorised level 2 and highly inspiring Ashtanga yoga teacher, about how yoga has evolved through his life.   
 
   Joey came to yoga in 1998 and since that time has become one of the most loved and influential Ashtanga yoga teachers teaching in the UK today.
 Before yoga, Joey had previously pursued the circus, martial arts and physical theatre. On graduating from Goldsmiths University, he began assisting Hamish Hendry at Ashtanga Yoga London and for 3 years he practised and assisted daily. During this time, he spent 2 or 3 months every year in Mysore practicing with Pattabhi Jois and Sharath.
 In 2004 he was authorised to teach by Pattabhi Jois and he then taught daily Mysore classes from 2005-2008 at Triyoga in Primrose Hill, London. In 2009 he relocated to Hebden Bridge and set up Ashtanga Yoga Leeds with the intention of supporting people’s daily yoga practice, this has now been running for eleven years.
 Alongside the more traditional ashtanga path, Joey has studied and practiced Iyengar yoga for fifteen years under Alaric Newcombe. Whilst mixing styles is often frowned upon, he finds the change in approach to be remarkably helpful in his personal practice, for allowing variation, and giving support to a wider variety of students’ needs.
 Joey’s teaching is rigorous and playful and his intention is to bring clarity and emphasis to sound alignment within the ashtanga system thereby demonstrating unity among different schools of postural yoga.

 Blending Yoga Traditions - Joey Miles Scott and Joey have known each other for over ten years and have been friends for the past eight. They have a connection that bonds them outside of yoga too. They are both fathers and have a love of dance culture.
 Scott and Joey spoke in December 2019 where they were both teaching at Purple Valley and have a deeply personal conversation. Joey shares openly and honestly about how his life has evolved through practicing yoga from a young age and shares about his evolution. He talks about how his contemplative practice developed and how his yoga practice, particularly Ashtanga and Iyengar, has evolved through blending both their traditions in a highly insightful and focused way.
  'Joey is so articulate. He is ability to share information his so rich and we could have gone on for another hour. Joey's insights on practice are inspiring and the way he talks about blending the practices of Ashtanga and Iyengar is gold. This podcast is essential for those thinking of how to move beyond the strict approach to Ashtanga yoga. Joey's story is of an inspiring inquisitiveness to practice and life.'

 62 Years of Practice - Ann Weston In this rich and warm conversation, Scott and Ann talk about how yoga has shaped Ann's life since she began practicing back in 1957. Ann has never rested on her laurels and has always kept moving to see what's possible in her life. She has navigated all the major explosions in yoga from the 1960s onwards. Ann shares how she met all of this while raising a family.
 This is a classic Stillpoints podcast. A conversation that inspires through the story of one person who has practiced for over 60 years and has always had a deep passion for yoga. Yoga practitioners and teachers should listen to Ann's story as it harks back to a time before most of us were born, before the big explosions we know that have catapulted yoga around the world. Ann talks about the explosions of yoga in her early years that most of us are unaware of.

Straight Shot Radio,"A straight forward, no nonsense take on functional fitness, nutrition, and health from Straight Shot Training. I know, it's a weird request, but listen to this episode of the podcast and you'll hear why a different approach to caloric management may be more effective for you than the trendy studios and fitness gadget companies would like you to think. This method will also help you address all of the other things you should be working on in the gym besides just losing weight (if that's your goal). Are you training? Or just exercising? Learn the difference in this episode and how training with structure and purpose can keep you from burnout in the gym and actually get you on your way to where you want to be. You've heard it all before: ""running sucks"" ""cardio is Hardio"" ""cardio will kill your gains""... but how universally important is cardiorespiratory conditioning for athletes of all types? In this episode, I get into how even just a little cardio will make you a better lifter and how it can improve your recovery to increase your total fitness.  Here are two scary stories about the times that I missed landing backflips due to not committing to the movement. The concept of doing a backflip probably isn't relevant to you, but I tie it into how the fear of commitment is making your lifts worse (and more dangerous), and how this lesson that I teach in the gym can be applied to your life outside of it. I've competed as a runner, a Crossfitter, and a Strongman and have noticed a dangerous glorification of pain and acceptance of injuries as ""just part of training"" for those sports. I lay out in this episode my counter to this trend in hopes that you can feel awesome while still performing well over the course of your life. My thoughts on a common question and how to get a better answer when asking about how someone got to where they are with their fitness. "

All while enjoying a few drinks.Have a question you'd like us to answer?  Submit it via our website and we'll feature you on the show!So pour a couple fingers, throw a barbell on your back and listen up. The U.S. News &amp; World Report recently released its results for Best Diets for 2020. But there’s nothing like the “2019 Best Of” list, the Strength &amp; Scotch way. The list is based on their pillars of health – Nutrition, Exercise, Sleep, Stress Reduction, and Relationship/Human Connection. They’re also giving out some great tips in each category for 2020!

Want to work with Coach Heavey, know more about him on strengthandscotch.com/coaching. Grant, Heavey, and Coach Nicole talk about training splits (Nope, not the kind of splits gymnasts do). They also touch on some factors that influence what kind of training split you should be doing. 
If you want to know how to improve your training splits with a coach, check out strengthandscotch.com/coaching.

Today, Grant and Heavey, along with their very special guest, Heavey's wife Nicole, are doing a listener roundup around body comp, meal prep, and counting calories.

Nicole is the head coach at Evidence-Based Athlete. She definitely the perfect person to give insights into these listeners' questions."
Strength Love Metal,"Retired roller derby athlete, Crossfit coach, and lifelong metalhead, MG ""Raevyn"" Vanover talks all things fitness, metal, and harnessing elements of both in and out of the gym. Be strong, love hard, live metal! On January 7th, the music world lost a LEGEND, when Neil Peart, drummer and lyricist for Rush lost his 3 year battle with brain cancer. On this episode, I take a bit of a break from talking fitness to pay tribute to Mr. Peart, and talk about the impact Rush's music has had on myself and fans all over the world. 
In addition, I give an update on my progress in the Caffeine &amp; Kilos Add A Mile Challenge, announce the dropping of new merch in the merch store (BUY ALL THE THINGERS!), and update on the upcoming Strength Love Metal Community WOD.

linktr.ee/StrengthLoveMetal Today we talk about outdated steroetypes, misinformation, biases, and other b******t that can confuse and intimidate the hell out of folks who are new to the fitness world. We outline a few tips on how to find the right trainer for you and your goals, and what kind of trainers to avoid.  In addition, I share a fun mini-wod/warm-up that I utilized this week, and may have accidentally created a new, meaner variation on that wod. Oh yeah, and I'm a sadist. &gt;;)  

linktr.ee/StrengthLoveMetal Episode 3 is finally up! Had some unfortunate things happen last week that put a damper on my holidays, but some kind and generous individuals reached out to help, so yaaay!  This week we talk about Seven Kingdoms and their new Empty Eyes coffee from Trilogy Coffee. I am a coffee fiend, and Seven Kingdoms is one of my favorite power metal bands, so trust and believe I'll be purchasing their coffee and reviewing on a future episode. In addition, we talk about an outing to Sedona a few months back that led to adopting the mantra ""tell fear to f**k off"", and what exactly that phrase means to me. A bit aggressive, I know, but that's what SLM is about, amirite?

This week's episode was all about the underdog. I talked about the prevalence of Lacuna Coil's music in my playlists and their impact on my outlook on life with ongoing themes of overcoming adversity and harnessing inner strength. From there I shared my story of overcoming physical and mental setbacks (""brain worms"") when I played roller derby, and using that experience to not only turn my personal outlook around, but to reframe the term ""underdog"" as the ULTIMATE strong badass. Finally, I announce the ""Patron Saint of Underdogs"" segment that will appear in future episodes, where a nominated individual will be featured for fighting through adversity and achieving awesomeness.

Strength Sessions,"What drives people to grow, to transform, to reinvent themselves? Two blokes, who through Men’s Health have become familiar with unlikely sources of strength, talk with guests who have experienced profound shifts in perspective, strength and well-being, either physically, mentally or emotionally.MH editor Scott Henderson and national treasure Lincoln Lewis co-host this exploration of modern masculinity and the notion of ‘strength’.As the banter flows, the lads chat to Hollywood movie stars, athletes, musicians, industry experts and extraordinary blokes on how they’ve found overcome adversity to find strength in their lives. Trent Maxwell or ‘Lifeguard Maxi’, as he is more commonly known, is the youngest ever Professional Lifeguard to work at Australia’s world-famous Bondi Beach. Maxi started lifeguarding at Bondi over 11 years ago as a 16-year-old trainee and his inspiring Lifeguard career has been well documented on Channel 10’s award winning show Bondi Rescue.
In 2016 Maxi became a Firefighter for NSW Fire + Rescue, then in 2018 Maxi earned the position of Qualified Rescue Operator as part of the Heavy Rescue team at the City of Sydney Fire Station. This unique career combination see’s Maxi as a much-needed young, positive, male role model for future generations.
In 2018 Maxi added the title of published Author to his credits, releasing his ‘Maxi the Lifeguard’ educational, fictional, children’s book series. In 2018 Maxi founded social enterprise ‘Live Learn Survive’ with business partner Leigh Mason with a vision to teaching life saving skills to children and young adults.

He had blazed his own path as an actor, winning a Logie Award in 2008 for his work on Home and Away. More recently, however, as new roles proved elusive and dark moods descended, the 31-year-old began to feel as though the pillars holding up his life were crumbling. Needing something solid to grab on to, Lewis accepted an MH challenge to overhaul his body in 12 weeks. What he learned along the way could be the blueprint for a transformation of your own.  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy If you haven’t heard of Todd Liubinskas yet, take a knee: he’ll be a household name in no time. Coach, business owner, charity operator and MH fitness director, Liubinskas is a force to be reckoned with. You wouldn’t expect a bloke with Liubinskas’s credentials to be a paragon of selflessness and humility. But it’s these qualities – combined with his stellar command of all matters fitness (and, yes, the fact he’s jacked) that sealed his position at the top of the Australian fitness pyramid.
The ultimate nice guy of the fitness industry, Liubinskas spent 17 years exploring all that elite conditioning has to offer, before founding three fitness-focused businesses: CSP Gym, CSP Athlete Factory and Coaching Zone Five Dock.
Todd's impact extends beyond the gym. He works with local youth in Sydney’s west, and with the charity Let’s Get Going, which provides mentoring for adults with physical and intellectual disabilities, as well as his most notable achievement of 2019: the creation of global running phenomenon The 440.

So it was for Nathan Charles, the only person with cystic fibrosis ever to play a contact sport at an elite level. His whole life has been about taking precautions and diminishing risk.


“I always had the belief that I was, I wouldn’t say destined, but that this is what I was going to do and I wasn’t going to take no for an answer,” he says of his dream of playing professional rugby. “Ever since I could talk I wanted to be a Wallaby. It was never a sense of entitlement. It was just more of a belief that if you want something bad enough you won’t let anything get in your way. The only thing stopping you is yourself.”


You’ve probably heard athletes, entrepreneurs or motivational speakers say something similar in the past. The difference with Charles is that it isn’t a hollow aphorism. In cystic fibrosis he had an obstacle that traditionally shrinks your opportunities in life. Charles wouldn’t let it. “He seems to have defied science and defied logic,” former Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie once said of him. 


His story can inspire anyone who wants to achieve something extraordinary.  For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy WARNING - POOR AUDIO
“I’m very precious with my time, which is why I’m so disciplined,” says Wahlberg, who’s surprisingly softly spoken. “I try to inspire people that there is enough time in the day to accomplish all of your goals and find that great balance.”
We all have the same 24 hours in each day, but as Wahlberg identifies, how we use those hours really determines where we end up in life. From troubled teen years to the F45 investing, acting and producing legend he's become, Wahlberg now makes every second count towards building a solid future for himself, his family and those he inspires.

Strength Strategies Podcast,Strength strategies podcast is designed to help its followers navigate maze of information that is the fitness industry. The host Dylan Hoyt and our guests are here to remove the guesswork and gimmicks to bring its followers effective strategies to achieve their fitness goals.
Strength to Rise,"Strength to Rise is a mini documentary and podcast series featuring many of the fitness industry’s best. Using “fitness as a vehicle” Tyler English and Andrew McConaha aim to bring all things fitness industry together. Chad Wesley Smith, owner of Juggernaut Training Systems, is accompanied by Greg Panora (Former World Record holder in Geared Lifting) and Vincent Dizenzo (Powerlifter/Bench Press Specialist) in our last episode of the season. These well known athletes are asked who their biggest influences are, and their response is remarkable.  Powerlifters, Bodybuilders, CrossFitters, and fitness-lovers alike will share that they are influenced by men or women from various fitness backgrounds, so why is it that there is a divide in the fitness community?  These guys might be on the right to track as to why. Despite the different gyms, meets, federations and sponsorships; these men share a mutual respect and admiration for each other. Can the rest of the fitness community follow suit? 

See the video on our Strength to Rise YouTube channel at https://youtu.be/GOYVYBSncSw Jeff and Robin of TrueForm Runner bring to light the importance of education in all aspects of fitness. Just as form is critical in strength training and lifting, it is also critical in running, and even something as simple as walking. Unlike any other of its kind, this motorless treadmill focuses on the mechanics and quality of movement to help correct form and make its users more efficient runners. With CrossFit having the belief that running is a fundamental part of fitness, the TrueForm Runner has been implemented in many of its gyms and meets, and is quickly becoming a commodity in various other types of gyms.  Tyler and Drew ask their guest speakers what sets them apart and what features we should expect to see in the near future.

 See the video on our Strength to Rise YouTube channel at https://youtu.be/ceoN2oMNCT0 Pro Strongman, and overall bad ass, Matt Mills gives insight as to why it is important to take all approaches of training into consideration when becoming your best self. Matt gives credit to Strongman training for his athleticism and Powerlifting training for his strength, but makes it clear that neither is attainable without the proper nutrition and mental preparation. Although Tyler and Drew have intentions to bring the fitness community together as a whole, a little friendly competition is sparked. A Strongman, a CrossFitter, and a Powerlifter…who wins this fight? 

See the video on our Strength to Rise YouTube channel at https://youtu.be/ncVwosGFLgc Wil Fleming, an Olympic weightlifting coach and sole owner of Force Fitness Performance in Bloomington, IN, gives us insight into the wonderful world of weight lifting. In an effort to have various fitness communities become one, Wil explains how weightlifting has been incorporated in CrossFit and independent gyms alike. In this episode, Wil covers the benefits of weightlifting, the importance of education, favorite books that have inspired him, and fun facts about his upbringing (spoiler alert: Wil is a part time Hawk whisperer!).

See the video on our Strength to Rise YouTube channel at https://youtu.be/EoU7txLIJgc Most people in the fitness industry have, at one point, considered becoming a coach, or wondered what it takes to open a gym of their own. With the fitness industry rapidly expanding, there are certain values that one must possess to stand out and ultimately grow a loyal following. Based on real life eye-opening experiences, Tyler and Drew tell us what it takes to become a successful business owner. Learn how Strength to Rise will use the fitness industry as their vehicle for communication as they set the pace for the future of the STR podcast series.

Stronger Medicine Podcast,"The podcast that's here to affirm that you are your strongest medicine. Conversing with clinicians, patients, and (extra)ordinary people. Topics cross the thresholds of clinical medicine, strength and conditioning, lifestyle, behaviour and ways of living that enable us to maximise our own therapeutic potential, as well as that of modern clinical medicine.www.strongermedicine.com In September 2015, Nick put his generalised muscular aches down to his keen squash playing, but soon after, other unexplained symptoms started to appear. On Christmas eve of 2015, Nick was found to have inoperable cancer on a CT scan, being diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer the following month. 



At 625 ng/ml, his PSA (a prostate tumour marker) was 150x the upper limit, and he was given a gleason score of 9/10 (the most aggressive rating for prostate cancer).



Since that time, Nick has taken an extremely proactive approach to his cancer and health. He has assembled around him a multi-disciplinary team, including Cancer Buddies, complementary oncologists, yoga masters, psychotherapists, nutritionists, Chinese herbalists &amp; acupuncturists, strength &amp; conditioning experts, buddhists, GPs, nurses, conventional oncologists and his wife.



Alongside this, Nick has been on a mission to share what he has found through his own journey, and has been writing and speaking about the undeniable impact of lifestyle on our health and, as he sees it in his case, his own experiences with cancer. 



Thank you Nick for your generous time on the show.

Get in touch: julian@strongermedicine.com www.strongermedicine.com Aaron Stark was almost a school shooter. 



He experienced a childhood of relentless violence, trauma and being told he was worthless. Moving from school to school, with a chaotic family constantly evading social services and the police, he plummeted deeper and deeper into despair and depression. Despite reaching out a number of times, he remained mostly alone until, driven to ‘annihilation’, he resolved to buy a gun and attack a school.



An almost banal, everyday act of human touch from his friend, Mike, was the turning point that averted a catastrophe.



Listen as Aaron discusses his childhood experience, how he ended up in that dark place, how he narrowly missed an atrocity, and his journey of recovery that has lasted decades. He tells us about how surreal life has been since he started to talk openly about his experiences, and the thousands of people that have contacted him and, ultimately, how this despair can happen to any of us; not just monsters.

Get in touch: julian@strongermedicine.com www.strongermedicine.com Professor Sabina Brennan is the author of the book ‘100 Days to a Younger Brain‘, which details how we can maximise our cognitive and brain health for as long as possible, through lifestyle. 



She is a neuroscientist with specific interest in the risk factors and impact of lifestyle on dementia, cognition and brain health across the lifespan. Currently as a Research Assistant Professor in the Neuroscience department at Trinity College Dublin, she made her move into this field through studying her psychology undergraduate degree at the age of 42, after leaving her previous career in acting (a leading role on Ireland’s soap opera, Fair City). 



As well as her work in lifestyle and neuroscience, Sabina is passionate about challenging the stereotypes that pervade ageing in the West, asserting that there is much to celebrate in our later years and that we are capable of much more than society would allow us to think. She has created around 30 short animations in multiple languages across the globe to share education on brain health and lifestyle.



In this episode, we discuss: 



Why Sabina wrote the book (2:33) Why we are not doomed to decline despite our brains shrinking with age (8:25)How even a brain that appears to be ravaged by Alzheimer’s dementia may not result in any outward appearance of disease (10:25)Sabina gets into the difficult area of how best intentions can sometimes steal independence from loved ones and patients (20:30)The concepts of brain resilience and reserve (22:55)The odd lack of awareness about our brains (29:14)Sabina does a deep dive into how sleep is perhaps the most important thing for our brain health (32:20)Learn why stress can be both bad and good for us (47:50) How your attitude and approach to life can make or break you (56:26)We close with reflecting on how we are absolutely sabotaging ourselves as we age through how society views the process of getting older (01:06:09).

[DISPLAY_ULTIMATE_SOCIAL_ICONS] I’d never before put into perspective that the ten year survival of type 2 diabetes is worse than many cancers. Today, we get into what can be done about this, once and for all.



Mike Lean MA, MB, BChir, MD (Cambridge), FRCP (Edinb), FRCPS (Glasgow), FRSE holds the chair of Human Nutrition, is an acute medicine consultant physician, and has completed extensive research in obesity, nutrition and diabetes.  In more recent years, his work as joint Principle Investigator with Prof Taylor and team has uniquely proven that diabetes is a reversible disease process. The DiRECT trial is the first of its kind to have focused on remission of diabetes as its outcome, by calorie restriction alone. Almost 50% of those recruited reversed their diabetes, with 9 in 10 people who lost 15kg achieving complete remission and coming off all diabetes medication.



In this episode, Prof Lean tells us where he thinks we have gone wrong with diabetes and its management. We learn what actually causes diabetes, the relation of body weight and fat to this disease, and why those who seem to be of a normal weight can still get diabetes. Prof Lean tells us why just focusing on good blood sugar control may not be adequate, the findings of the DiRECT trial, and how YOU or your patients can actually reverse your diabetes, and come off medications completely. We hear about the ins and outs of approaches such as low carbohydrate, fasting and calorie restriction for diabetes management, and is there such a thing as a ‘healthy food’?



This was a real privilege as Prof Lean is at the absolute forefront of diabetes research and management, and is in great demand internationally to share his work. He was kind enough to steal some time to talk with me during a busy working day when he had just finished his morning ward round, and so I’m grateful for the opportunity.



Let me know what you thought! Do you have diabetes? Do you care or work with people with diabetes? Get in touch at julian@strongermedicine.com

Dr Mike Banna is a GP Partner in the south of England, Regional Director of the British Society of Lifestyle Medicine, a co-host on the Fitness Unfiltered Podcast, and proactively brings much needed balance and realism to topics across medicine and fitness. 



His transformational journey that began around ten years ago resulted in him almost halving his bodyweight. He has a passion for mental health and realistic, achievable lifestyle change, whilst bringing his own skin in the game and transformational experience to his interactions with his patients. 



In this episode we discuss his work (6:22) the psychology, practice and challenges inherent in his transformation (10:26), and the narratives we tell ourselves (27:30). We also deep dive into how Dr Banna’s work with patients was impacted (33:10) the complexity of lifestyle (36:30), and how areas such as weight loss can be made way over-simplified to our detriment. We discuss the danger of echo chambers in the fitness industry (45:25), the pros and cons of utilising a ‘call-out’ approach (52:45), and the direction and some potential concerns of the lifestyle medicine field (59:27). 



A big thanks to Dr Banna, who can be found at the following places:Instagram and twitter @drmikethe2nd Also check out his excellent co-hosted podcast, Fitness Unfiltered  Dr Sullivan was an Emergency Medicine physician for 25 years before deciding to become a full-time strength coach. He works predominantly with older adults, and is a major force within the strength and fitness industry as an advocate of strength training as a ‘medicine’. 



A diverse and varied career, he was previously in the Marine Corps, an associate professor of EM, a PhD, a science fiction writer, and physiologist. 



He joins me today to delve into why barbell and strength training is a potent medicine, perhaps even an antidote, against decrepitude and ‘human apoptosis’. We hear about clients in their 90’s deadlifting, how we can fight against the entropy of ageing, and how we can ‘prescribe’ barbell training as a medicine. 



Clinicians stand up and take notice. This man is prescribing his clients with a more powerful prescription than you may realise.

Strongtown Talks,"Conversations with the people of the CrossFit Strongtown community.Amgonst other things - we talk about what first brought them to the gym, life, and the challenges they've encountered along the way.New episodes released every Monday at 6:00amLocal to Southbury CT. In this episode, recorded on January 26th 2020, Mikey and I sit down with Nico to discuss what it means to go ""Rx"" on a workout. 

We talk a bit about the evolution of the Rx Levels at Strongtown, some of the minutia of the Judges Course and previous CrossFit Games workouts as well as just catch up on things in general. In this episode recorded on January 19th, 2020,  Mikey and I sit down to catch up on the past week.

We draw numbers for our Super Bowl Squares to complete the board, we talk about our annual Strongtown Super Bowl workout...it's a classic, as well as this past weekends' Holiday Party (thank you Barry &amp; Becky for hosting!), and a little bit about our on going Strong Start Challenge. In this episode, recorded on January 12th, 2020, we get a chance to sit down with Heidi Gaber.

Heidi is a Social Worker and has been a regular face at our 6:00am class for the past 4 years.

The person who she is now and the person who tried out a class because her friend Taylor kept bugging her are two very different people.

She has literally transformed her life and gone from smoking 1-2 packs of cigarettes day to waking up at 5:00am and working out 5x a week.

We talk about what brought her to Strongtown (thank you Tots), nursing school, and working out with multiple auto-immune diseases amongst other things. In this episode recorded on January 5th 2020, we get a chance to sit down with Deb.

Deb is one of our 'most master' athletes at Strongtown, she's also one of our strongest.

She has lived an extraordinary life from waitressing Martha's Vineyard, to working as an executive out in Silicon Valley, to running a Farm &amp; CSA program, to most recently beating cancer.

She's an inspiration to everyone who knows her and I'm grateful we got a chance to catch up.  In this episode recorded on December 29th, 2019, Mikey and I sit down and talk about our recent 12 Days workout as well as our final workout of 2019 aka ""New Year's Eve Party with the Girls"".

This year's finale will be a 40 Minute AMRAP of Grace (or Isabell) ... and then Annie ... and then Fran ... and then Karen for a total of 570 reps per round. 

Like Christmas Eve, we'll be running classes at 8:00am &amp; 9:30am and closed on New Year's Day. In this episode recorded on December 22, 2019,  we get a chance to sit down &amp; catch up with Garrett Taggart.

Garrett has been a part of Strongtown since the early days.

Styrkebyrån,"Clara Fröberg och Johanna Barvelid är personliga tränare i Stockholm. Styrkebyrån är podden om att lyfta tunga grejer. En podcast både för dig som redan lyfter och för dig som skulle vilja prova. I dagens avsnitt har vi en rolig gäst - Chai Maibert body modification-konstnär som också är kettlebellcoach och introducerat oss i begreppet monoton träning. Vad är monoton träning? Hur konditionstränar man styrketräning och hur går ett kettlebellsmaraton till? Vilket är den perfekta pizzan? Brukar du känna mkt i ländryggen i dina marklyft? Idag pratar vi om att jobba med utlåsningen i rumpa och höft istället för att dra med ryggen. Benen och rumpmusklerna är stora och starka och det går att lära sig att använda dem mer istället för att skapa en obehaglig känsla i ryggen. Det som händer när du drar ut marklyften med ryggen är att du försöker korta hävarmen och börjar använda ryggmusklerna erektorerna på ett sätt som inte är nödvändigt.
 Några tips och tejkavejs till marklyften
  Långa armar är att föredra i marklyft :-) En kortarmad person kan uppleva att marklyften blir lite knäböjiga för att komma ner till stången, och kan på så vis inte jobba med höften optimalt. I ett marklyft vill du att höften ska vara högre än knäna i din startposition Tänk “förläng armarna” istället för att “knipa ihop” skulderbladen. (Se hur mycket armarna åker upp om du kniper ihop skulderbladen) Att istället dra stången mot dig och trycka ner axlarna istället (mot midjan) kortar hävarmen mellan stång och höft Från golv till knän: tryck dig genom eller mot golvet. Tänk: benpress. När stången passerar dina knän: tryck höften fram höften mot stången - hipthrust istället för att dra klart lyftet med ryggen. Din överkropp kommer rätas upp automatiskt, du behöver inte aktivt tänka “res upp ryggen” I veckans avsnitt pratar vi om att bänka med stopp. Vem kan ha fördelar av det, även om en inte tävlar i styrkelyft?
 Hålltider:
 0:00 Försnack

 Bänkpress med stopp.
 Vad är reglerna och hur fungerar det i tävling i styrkelyft?
 Touch and go - vad är det?
 Hur gör du när du bänkpressar med stopp?
Fyll bröstkorg med luft - hård!
 Kontrollera nedsänkningen
Äg bottenläget
Starka skuldror
Tryck på från botten

 Varför ska du bänka med stopp?
Mer TUT - tid under anspänning
Bättre kontroll
Mindre svaj
Mindre momentum - ingen hockeybombning
 Testa
Ta av lite vikt och börja göra alla dina reps med stopp. Det behöver inte vara 2 sekunder, det räcker med ett tydligt stopp på bröstet! Veckans kortavsnitt ägnar vi åt fem tips för dig som är ny till skivstångsträning. För många känns det lite extra läskigt att lägga en skivstång på ryggen eller göra marklyft med skivstång istället för kettlebells eller hantlar. Hur kan du tänka? Hur många set och reps ska du börja med? Vad är ett set och en rep egentligen?
  Skivstångsområdet är till för alla -  det spelar ingen roll hur stora eller hur många viktplattor du har på din stång.  Gör det enkelt och bestäm vilka övningar du ska göra innan träningspasset eller följa ett program. Välj till exempel två skivstångsövningar och gör en i taget.  När du ska göra bänkpress, knäböj, marklyft och stående press (med skivstång) kan det vara smart göra lite färre reps och set både för att jobba med maxstyrka men också för att det är lättare med tekniken vid färre reps. Till exempel fem reps per set. I början kommer du långt med att bara utföra övningen och lära dig rörelsen. Det kommer göra dig starkare. Så stressa inte med att öka vikterna. Lägg till exempel till ett extra set varje vecka i början. Du kan börja med 3 set med 5 reps.  Om du får frågan om du har mycket kvar. Svara trevligt att du har till exempel fem set kvar. Erbjud dig dela stång med hen. Personen kommer oftast säga nej!  Bonus: Titta på filmer och läs texter och lyssna på poddar om hur du gör övningarna, eller om du kan ta hjälp av en tränare med tekniken inför första gången. Det här är den roligaste tiden i din träningskarriär för du kommer gå framåt så mycket! Alla är nya på nåt i början. Skit i att du är ny och känn dig cool som kommer bli stark! Avsnittet är 16:57 minuter långt.  Dagens ämne handlar om en ny studie på styrketräning där 53 unga vuxna fick välja en vikt i tre styrketräningsövningar som de skulle göra 10 repetitioner av. 53 procent klarade fler reps än tio. Och särskilt kvinnor tog en för lätt vikt. Avsnittet är femton minuter och 52 sekunder. Studien: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31904718 Vi gjorde veckans försnack till ett eget avsnitt den här veckan eftersom det blev 38 minuter av prat om Sverigedemokraterna, klimatet och mens. Lyssna inte på detta!"
Stærk &amp; Smertefri,"Stærk & Smertefri er podcasten for dig, som vil lære mere om styrketræning, smerte, kost og sundhed på en nuanceret måde uden magiske b******t-løfter. Jacob Beermann fra Maxer.dk er din vært og guider dig igennem junglen af misinformation på en letforståelig måde, når han giver dig konkrete tips, overblik over videnskaben og overvejelser om hvorfor vi gør som vi gør. Med alderen falder styrke, knoglemasse og muskelmasse på grund af blandt andet aldring og mindre fysisk aktivitet. For nogle betyder det ikke så meget, mens det for andre fører til lavere livskvalitet og færre muligheder. Du kan dog gøre enormt meget selv gennem fysisk aktivitet og især styrketræning have mange fordele for at undgå reduceret funktionsevne, hvilket tab af styrke, knoglemasse og muskelmasse fører til.
 I episoden har jeg besøg af Charlotte Suetta, som er overlæge, dr.med., ph.d. og speciallæge i klinisk fysiologi og nuklearmedicin. Hun har forsket inden for muskelfysiologi i mange år og arbejder som klinisk professor ved Institut for Klinisk Medicin på Bispebjerg-Frederiksberg Hospital samt Herlev og Gentofte Hospital.
 I episoden snakker vi blandt andet om:

Det vigtigste at fokusere på i styrketræning for ældre.  Læs mere på https://maxer.dk/staerk-smertefri/styrketraening-aeldre Mange mennesker ønsker at forbedre deres kropsholdning. Nogle er allerede i gang ud fra tvivlsom rådgivning, de måske har læst på nettet. I denne podcast opsummerer jeg de fem største misforståelser, jeg oftest oplever folk har om hvad ""god"" og ""dårlig"" kropsholdning er samt hvilke konsekvenser det kan have.
 Kropsholdning er nemlig langt fra lige så vigtigt at fokusere på som mange mennesker tror - og bliver fortalt af behandlere.
 Læs mere på https://maxer.dk/artikler/5-misforstaaelser-kropsholdning Vores forståelse for smerte har udviklet sig en hel del i de sidste halvtreds år, men de fleste af disse videnskabelige fremskridt har i stor udstrækning kun haft ringe indflydelse på hvordan mange i dag behandler smerter.
 Når du er færdig med at læse denne podcast har du fået et større indblik i smertens kompleksitet og du vil kunne forholde dig mere kritisk i forhold til de mange udbydere af sundhedsydelser - og måske opleve at du har det bedre. Mange studier har nemlig vist at en øget indsigt i og forståelse af smerter blandt andet kan virke smertelindrende og øge ens funktionsniveau.

Der er ingen let løsning, men forståelse for mekanismerne bag kan være et første skridt. Spiseforstyrrelser hænger ofte sammen med blandt andet kropsdysmorfi og kropsidealer, hvor ønsket om en bestemt krop eller udseende bliver altoverskyggende.
 I episoden har jeg besøg af Mia Beck Lichtenstein, som har arbejdet som psykolog i 15 år, har en bachelor i idræt og en Ph.d. i træningsafhængighed fra Syddansk Universitet. Hun arbejder som lektor ved Institut for Psykologi på Syddansk Universitet og som psykolog og forsker ved Telepsykiatrisk Center i Region Syddanmark, hvilket er et forsknings- og udviklingsmiljø i psykiatrien. Mia forsker indenfor spiseforstyrrelser, træningsafhængighed, psykiske følger af idrætsskader og internetbaseret behandling af psykiske lidelser.
 I episoden snakker vi blandt andet om:
  De mest udbredte spiseforstyrrelser og atypiske spiseforstyrrelser. Mekanismerne bag udviklingen af spiseforstyrrelser. Myter og misforståelser om spiseforstyrrelser Behandling af spiseforstyrrelser - hvad er vejen frem?  Læs mere på https://maxer.dk/staerk-smertefri/spiseforstyrrelser Forskningen indenfor smertevidenskab har resulteret i et paradigmeskift. Et paradigmeskift, som faktisk er i gang lige nu, fra en strukturel tankegang, hvor vævsskade og slid anses som den primære årsag til smerter til den biopsykosociale smertemodel, hvor smerter har en multifaktoriel baggrund. I denne artikel vil jeg give dig et indblik i hvad smerte er, hvordan den kan forstås og afhjælpes.
  For at få en dybere forståelse for hvad smerter er, må vi se nærmere på hvordan kroppen, nervesystemet og hjernen fungerer. Det er især hjernen, denne artikel fokuserer på, da den spiller en helt central rolle i forståelsen af smerte.
 For at gøre det så forståeligt som muligt, vil jeg forklare dig den nyeste smertevidenskab gennem metaforer og tegninger. I denne artikel vil du lære om:
  Hvad er smerter? Hvad du kan bruge smerter til Hvorfor smerter nogle gange vedbliver Hvordan du kan blive smertefri

Antallet af mennesker med kroniske smerter er stigende og omkostninger til behandling af smerter er også stigende. Det har store omkostninger både for individet og samfundet, men alligevel bliver der leveret meget behandling af lav kvalitet i modstrid med hvad videnskaben peger i retning af. Hvad gør vi forkert som samfund og sundhedssystem?
 Morten Høgh er uddannet fysioterapeut, har en MSc i Pain Science and Society fra King's College i London og har netop afsluttet en PhD i smertevidenskab på Center for Neuroplasticitet og Smerte (CNAP) ved Aalborg Universitet. Han driver Videnomsmerter.dk og anser sig selv primært som kliniker med stor motivation og interesse i arbejdet med smerte ud fra et ønske om at klæde klinikere bedre på til gavn for patienterne.
 I episoden snakker vi blandt andet om:
  Hvorfor der er flere og flere mennesker med kroniske smerter i Danmark og globalt - hvad er det vi gør forkert? Hvordan vores forståelse af smerter har udviklet sig historisk - hvad ved vi i dag? Hvad vores forståelse af smerter betyder for hvordan vi behandler smerter. At kroniske smerter er blevet en diagnose i ICD-11 - og hvilken betydning det har.

On top of all that, the Summit For Wellness Podcast has doubled in listeners in the last year alone!

Below you will find the Top 5 Podcast Episodes from 2019. This was determined by the most amount of downloads within the first month of release of an episode, that way everyone has the same chance to place in the top 5!





Number 5















 Episode 86- Enhance Your Performance Nutrition with Geoff Lecovin 











Coming in at Number 5, we have Geoff Lecovin teaching us all about Performance Nutrition.







Often “performance” is associated with athletic abilities, but performance can take place in a lot of different areas of life, such as your career, or even handling your kids.







In Episode 86, Geoff walks us through his pyramid of steps to optimize your performance.







Number 4















Episode 93- Fix the Gut to Fix the Brain with Dr. Robert Silverman











Have you heard the saying “leaky gut, leaky brain”? If so, this episode will walk you through exactly how that saying came to be.







Dr. Robert Silverman is an expert on gut health, and teaches us about signs related to digestive stress. He walks us through lab tests to run, foods to remove, and steps to take to repair our system.











Number 3















Episode 88- Optimize Your Recovery in Sports with Lenny Parracino











You may remember Lenny from Episode 12 (the most downloaded episode we have) where he talks all about our soft tissue health.







In Episode 88, his focus in on recovery, and how to optimize our routines to improve function. While this episode was more focused on recovery in sports, he walks us through what protocols may look like for someone who isn't a pro athlete.







Number 2















Episode 85- Making Informed Supplement Choices with Kate Mahoney











The battle between Top 1 and 2 was within only a couple of downloads, so these episodes were really close. Coming in at Number 2 is Kate Mahoney and her talk about supplement choices.







You may have noticed all the bottles of supplements at every single grocery store. And you have probably seen how the price can vary pretty dramatically. So is the extra cost worth it for supplements? Or are all supplements created equal?







You'll have to listen to Episode 85 to find out.











Number 1















Episode 76- How to Succeed with Intermittent Fasting with Cynthia Thurl... Weight loss, at any given point, over 50% of Americans are in the process of trying to lose weight. With so many people trying to change their weight, you would think we'd have figured it out by now.

But weight loss is complicated, and we've had a lot of programming that has shaped the way we eat today (like ice cream parties for achieving something in school). So to unpack all of the habits we have built through the years takes time to work through.

Once you decide that you want to change your habits, these changes last a lifetime. As Mandi Green calls it, it isn't a diet, it is a lifestyle. And with any lifestyle, you have your ups and downs, but you are constantly trying to improve yourself.







 […] Environmental toxins are everywhere, and each day we are adding more and more chemicals into our environment.

The US imports or produces 27 trillion pounds of chemicals each year, which comes out to 74 billion pounds per day.

While throwing numbers out and talking about how polluted our planet is can be extremely gloomy, I think it is more helpful to learn actionable steps we can take to reduce our exposure and to detox our bodies.







 […] The data shows that as we age, our overall sexual health can start to run into some issues.

For men, this could mean you start to have erectile dysfunction. For women, you might have problems reaching orgasm, or maybe some issues with incontinence.

With advancements in medicine, we are starting to have more and more options to improve these types of health problems. And one of the newcomers on the block to help with sexual function is injection therapy.







 […] There is no way we can deny that humans generate a lot of waste. And it is too the point where our oceans and forests are filling up with trash.

If you don't believe that some people use forests as their own personal trash cans, then I welcome you to come to Seattle and hike on any trail within 1 hour from the city.

I think I can comfortably say that most people would like to reduce their trash usage, but just don't know where to start.

And the thought of changing everything we use can be overwhelming (which is the same feelings I had about it as well).

So in this episode, we talk about the most common everyday items that are used, and how to swap them out for more sustainable options without it feeling overwhelming.







 […] You may have heard the quote from Hippocrates that states ""All disease begins in the gut"". While it might not be 100% accurate that disease starts in the gut, the gut almost always is impacted in any disease state.

But what is more interesting is when the issues in the gut cause issues in the brain.

While this episode all about how to test and fix ""leaky gut, leaky brain"" issues, I'll give you a brief overview of some reasons the gut and brain can be connected.

Our world revolves around surfing! Surfboards have a very complex shape since they are made to be hydrodynamic objects. To understand the anatomy of a surfboard there are some parts that make it the best possible tool for gliding through the waves. Whether it is a 4-foot surfboard or a 13 feet paddle-board, the complexity is the same.
Surfboards have certain terms for each part, just like a human body, you will learn the anatomy of a surfboard. We start with the top of the board is the nose, then moving down to the rails, the fins, the tail, the leash, and so on.

But before starting out and break down the everyday essential surf equipment, you need to know those basics, making sure you know what is going on when putting your equipment together for your next surf session. It also helps when someone else talks to you about it and you look and sound like a pro. The list of surf equipment depends on your surfing level; a beginner will need less equipment then an advanced surfer depending on what the surfer’s preferences.
Not like a lot of extreme sports, surfing only requires you to have a surfboard and yourself to glide over the water on a wave. The everyday essential surf equipment will be a surfboard, leash, wax, and fins. But like I said before, as you progress you might need more equipment such as surf gadgets, your favorite surfboard, and a backup, a surfboard bag and so on.

   There is one major mistake we make when we want to lose weight. We go on a diet. We might lose weight, but 80% or more of us will gain that weight back again. Part of the reason we do that is we want a quick and easy fix. But for lasting change to happen quick and easy won’t work.
 In order to keep the weight off we must change our lifestyle. To do we have an intense desire for what we really want. Which means, we have to know why we want to lose weight in the first place. We also have to accept where we are, own our issues and then, surrender them to God.
 Walking out our journey will involve every part of us—body, soul and spirit. Don’t miss the exercise I mention in this podcast. It will be very revealing.

 Discovery Is A 2020 Word
 One word from God can make all the difference in our lives. Just one word! At the beginning of the year, I look forward to God giving me a word to define the year. He’s done this for me for a long time, but I didn’t start keeping track of those words until 2013, which was a pivotal year for me. That was the year He gave me the word grace. That word has made all the difference in my life.
 This year He gave me the word discovery. I was a little let down by that word. It just didn’t seem very spiritual. However, when God began pulling back the curtain, I was amazed at what I saw. Come with me on a journey of discovery of how just one word can change us completely.
 Share your 2020 word for us by submitting a review to Apple Podcasts or commenting on this episode at https://TeresaShieldsParker.com/podcast/. You can also send us an email to info@teresashieldsparker.com. I’d love to hear from you. Episode 008—Leaving a Legacy
 What legacy are you leaving to your family? Here are a few questions to ponder based on Deuteronomy 30:19. What have I done to my children and to my family? What bad habits am I teaching them? What comfort foods will they become addicted to? Is there any way I can turn this around? Have I already done too much damage?
 What things do I want to change now in order to make my life better in the future? What kind of legacy do I want to leave that would honor my life and honor my God?

Swetec Podcast,"A podcast that's all about ice hockey development and physical training for everyone and tips. Based on the experiences and results over the years, as well as on new evidence based facts. 1 år sedan jag (Dag) startade min hälsoresa och resultatet talar för sig själv. Men vad är viktigast att gå ner -35 kg eller lära sig hur mycket man äter eller hur mycket man kan äta? Att äta sundare kost som påverkar kroppen bättre och minska risken att kanske dö i förtid. Många frågor och tankar. 

Hoppas ni gillar oss på podbean, acast, sportifi och iTunes. Under helgen har jag sett och möt flera spelare som gett mig intryck att vi har mycket att jobba med. Hur bedrivs ungdomshockey 2019? Är uppspel i U12 viktigt? Skall DM vara kvar? Nä tycker inte jag.
Sedan hur jobbar elitspelare idag med skridskodetaljer för att använda kraften och energin bäst? Inte bra..... Detta lägger Dagge in sina synpunkter och tips ni kan tänka på. Även med en 11 årig spelare som tycker till om sin hockeyträning. (obs dåligt ljud.)

SWOLL NERD RADIO,"A podcast that brings two different worlds together. Fitness, and everything nerdy."
SXF Podcast,"Let’s talk about fitness, life and, shenanigans Our first non-coach interview! Heidi 'Oma' Davis was gracious enough to join us and answer all of our questions. She is one of the few grandmothers in the gym and consistently crushes it! She talks about everything from being a teen mother, battling injuries and what she truly loves about CrossFit. She is loved by everyone and it was truly a pleasure to have her on as our first guest, which is only fitting because she was our first member! 

*There is explicit language in this episode. Be aware of sensitive ears listening in! We get to dive into Coach Melissa's background and mindset regarding fitness and nutrition! Also, we get off topic roughly 51% of the podcast. Most importantly, we learned some insightful things and had a lot of fun during this and we are 'mama proud' of this episode! Let us know if you have questions, critiques or ideas for us as we move forward. Thank you to all of our listeners! We get to sit down with Coach Kayla and get to know more about her background, favorite coaching styles and learn about her vast knowledge of 90's country music! Drinks and laughs all around. Enjoy! In our second episode we get to know Coach Buddy a little bit more in depth, talk about a little bit more of the history of SXF and have some laughs at both of our expense.

T Talk with T-Fit,"Exploring current fitness topics, women empowerment, myths about fitness, nutrition and what actually works to keep us fit and healthy. Does this sound like you? Running in at the last minute to your workout - jumping into a fitness class that already started - jumping in to your run or starting that weight training workout without any movement prep? If it does - please listen to this! The number one excuse I get from people is they can't come to early morning workouts because they just can't get up! I've heard more excuses than I can count but not being able to get out of bed and get going is one of the top ones! In this episode I'm hoping to give you a few tips that will make this transition a lot easier! In this podcast we talk with Jamie while she's working out, heavy breathing and all, talking about the importance of fueling your body for your workouts or just LIFE It's not all or nothing....don't treat January as a 30 day start and stop. Create healthy habits you can carry with you all year long... When you are looking for a trainer - what do you ask him or her? I'll tell you what I always get asked . . .

Take 5 for Your Health and Wellbeing,"The monthly Take Five for Your Health and Wellbeing podcast provides science-based health and wellbeing tips and interviews with experts. This podcast is brought to you by the University of Minnesota’s Earl E. Bakken Center for Spirituality & Healing. ""I'll be honest, the first time I heard about clinical hypnosis, I was a little bit skeptical. My only experience with hypnosis was in high school when a performer came and made a whole bunch of my classmates do a bunch of crazy things on stage, like walking like a duck, or clucking like a chicken, or doing Elvis impersonations. That was my experience with hypnosis. So, when I first heard this researcher talk about the benefits of clinical hypnosis I was really skeptical, but he made such a strong case for the scientific basis for hypnosis and all the different things it can help that I quickly changed my mind and started looking into it more, and found that it can really be beneficial for a large range of clinical entities."" The holiday season is a time for family, friends, food... and stress. While many people enjoy celebrating with loved ones, the pressures of holiday gift-buying, travel, and overindulgence can take their toll. In this holiday special, adapted from one of our live webinars, Mary Jo Kreitzer, the Center's founder and director, offers tips to deal with the different stressors that arrive during the holidays.

The Take Back Your Life Project Podcast,"The Take Back Your Life Project Podcast with Erin Ortiqeaux  is your go-to resource for real honest up to date and practical problem-solving advice that will help you become the best version of yourself. #TBYLP Podcast offers topics that not only affect you but also the people you love. Erin has a no nonsense approach and serves up self-help in a hard-hitting, cut through the b******t, real talk way that is applicable today.  As Erin shares her insight on topics like boundaries, perfectionism, self-doubt, relationships, staying focused, achieving goals and more, you may find yourself staying in the car or extending your workout as you listen to impactful advice that can be the reality check you need to change your life. We all have that little negative voice inside our heads. The question is, is it telling us the truth or is it all a big fat lie? Do you allow that voice to dictate your choices? If you are tired of that voice calling the shots, holding you back and preventing you from having the relationships you want and from reaching your goals, this episode is for you. Learn the secret behind that voice, and how to handle it. We've all needed to have a tough conversation, but that knot wells up in our bellies and we decide...maybe later. Mastering the skill of having difficult conversations is a skill everyone needs. Whether it's with a boss who takes advantage, or a family member who is nosey or a spouse or partner that makes you feel unappreciated, or a friend who ignores your feelings. Learn to have those tough talks, heal your relationships, build your confidence and stop feeling like you need to bite your tongue. If you struggle in any of your relationships, personal or professional it may not be for the reasons you think. Maybe you're stressed out, or you’ve been betrayed, maybe someone drains you emotionally, maybe there's a lack of trust in the relationship. There are a million reasons your relationships may be in trouble. The problem is, most relationship problems are NOT actually relationship problems. They are personal problems that have trickled over into your relationships.

On today's episode I will help you uncover which of your relationship struggles are actually personal struggles and how to start the process of healing you and in turn healing and growing your relationships. This episode is part #5 in our series on Better Boundaries For A Better Life. This episode is all around BOUNDARIES IN BUSINESS. Do you have team members/employees/clients or customers that take advantage of you? Do you struggle with guilt when you set limits in your business? Do you find yourself working or answering emails/text messages after hours? Are you stressed out? This episode we dig into all the ways that boundaries play out in your business and how you may NOT EVEN KNOW there is a problem until you're stressed out, borderline burn out or in financial trouble. Start Taking Back Your Business TODAY by setting boundaries without the GUILT. This episode is part #4 in our series on Better Boundaries For A Better Life. Do you have people in your life that take advantage of you? Do you struggle with guilt when you say NO? Do you want to feel appreciated and valued more? This episode we talk about all this and more.

TEEP THIS - American Muay Thai,"Discover the most beautiful and devastating striking discipline on earth, known as the Art of 8 Limbs through the personal journeys of professional and amateur Muay Thai fighters. Dany Bill is a 7-Time World Muay Thai champion from Muay Thai's golden era and touted as possibly the most technically gifted fighter to ever compete in the sport of Muay Thai.  Dany shares insights from his unique journey, locker-room stories and inside information behind his numerous victories against the best Muay Thai fighters across the globe during Muay Thai's celebrated Golden Era.  Dr. Jason Park is a Physical Therapist, Board-certified Sports Clinical Specialist and a Sports Performance consultant. I honestly hope that there is a ""Dr. Jason Park"" facility one day, because Jason is truly a multi-talented human. We got together and talked about his fight history, his ""Muay Thai thesis"" and more. Alex could very well be the first transgendered individual to enter the Muay Thai ring.  We sat down to talk about that and a whole lot more. A conversation with likely the hardest working man in combat sports about discipline, principles and how fighting keeps everything in perspective. This episode features my conversation with one of the most feared young fighters making waves around the planet in both the Muay Thai and Kickboxing circuits.  Regian Eersel aka The Immortal is the current Lion Fight Super Middleweight World Champion and I spent some time with Regian and his trainer Paul learning more about what it feels like to be a world champion at only 24 years of age and how the American Muay Thai scene appears from his perspective in Holland, the world capital of Kickboxing. In this episode Joe and I get way into the behind the scenes of some of his epic fights against top tier opponents including Travis Clay and Eric Luna. I learned all about what it is to be Chomorro and we explored just how different Muay Thai fighting is from other fight sports.  We talked about life, self-awareness, tradition and how knowing ones self and honoring that knowledge can order your steps toward living a fulfilled life."

Think Fit. Be Fit.,"Think Fit. Be Fit.Effective thinking for potent workouts Think Fit. Be Fit. is dedicated to creating a new conversation about your exercise. Our podcast helps to uncover how the fitness industry has misled us, and it will show you that if you believe in your ability to improve your body through exercise, you don’t need to rely on diluted or shallow information. From there, you can then educate yourself about the thing you are trying to change – your body! Then, by engaging in a process of self-mastery, you will discover the secrets of exercise.Think Fit. Be Fit. ensures that people don’t miss out on living a better life because they don't understand that body awareness is a combination of taking feedback, listening, and learning – not self-judgement and meeting societal expectations. We encourage our listeners to not choose unhappiness over uncertainty and to embrace the process!Jennifer Schwartz, host and founder of Impact Your Fitness and Impact Sport Science Group, has helped hundreds of athletes and people around Washington, DC, move without pain and exercise to their fullest potential. Her techniques are best described as the intersection of exercise mechanics, muscle expertise, and embracing curiosity. In Jennifer’s view, the human body is a wonderful teacher if you know how to listen to it, and being open and having fun is part of that amazing process! Welcome to Exercise Science Insider #7 with Rob DiDinato, whom is my classmate and colleague in the elite MATRx program and a previous guest from October. (here's our first episode)  
 There are discussions around targeting vulnerable areas for strengthening in all types of athletes.  I’ve always entertained the idea that enhancing muscular foot strength works incredibly well for most athletes- for many reasons. In this episode you’ll hear our theories on this, I hope you find it as fascinating as we do! 
 The theme of this episode is ‘mindful motion’.  This is a conversation built off our first one in regards to isometrics and Muscle Activation Techniques™.
  
 Please enjoy and let us know if you have any questions or are interested to learn more about foot muscles and athletic performance.

   Functional Nutrition, Sports Nutrition and Female Leadership with Jaclyn Sklaver of Athleats Nutrition.
 When it comes to the complexity of your health, we have to think bigger than just making fitness and nutrition as simple as fast food. You must think of it as nurturing an asset. There’s no better person to help us see the big picture about nutrition and a long-term successful relationship with our food than Jaclyn Sklaver MS, CNS, LDN, CDN Board Certified &amp; Licensed.

 If you just have a love affair with healthy eating (like me), you’ll relate to the excitement in my voice as I ask Jaclyn questions on all my favorite nutrition topics!
  
 If you are interested in using a nutrition professional for your own fitness or athletic goals, this episode will help you understand the value of science based Functional Nutrition and you’ll receive tips on researching in this vast field of study. 
  
 If you are a budding professional in athletic training or sports nutrition, you don’t want to miss the real talk about the industry.

 It’s no secret that I’m passionate about what I do, and with the turn of the decade, I re-hash my own exciting, emotional and sometimes not-so-sexy journey in the business.
 If you’re an entrepreneur yourself, this episode is for you - as I’m sure you can relate to a lot of the foibles from getting injured during a side gig, fired from a random desk job, to feeling fulfilled every single day with my hands-on work.
 If you’re a fitness junkie, this podcast will give you more insight to the industry, my background and where my passions lie.

  Neuro-linguistic Programming information Welcome to the second Boutique Fitness Guide on Think Fit. Be Fit. Podcast!
  
 We love the idea of boutique fitness for the greater good of our collective fitness and for creating valuable health assets.  A sense of belonging and managing a healthy lifestyle are what Boutique Fitness studios offer that the bigger gyms are striving to copy and why we keep going back.  
  
 Even though some studios are getting $300 a month from their clients, the quality is not styled to accommodate all the injuries lying beneath the surface of those of us exercising with old injuries. The reality is we need a critical view and legit injury prevention advice before committing to what seems to be the most popular classes.  
  
 What is critical review of exercise?  Most exercise or class reviews are focused on what sells.  I have nothing to gain by sharing my views on these classes except to show you that your body deserves an individualized approach to improving your exercise.  My belief is that with applicable basic science knowledge we can make these types of decisions about fitness classes.

 The Stress Adaptation Curve promotes the understanding that creating change and progress in your life isn’t a linear process.Our hope with exercise is that our body creates “functional adaptations” like improved health, more muscle, less fat, and increased performance.  However this isn’t possible without proper recovery.
  
 The point at which the body responds poorly to exercise or any stress is during the recovery period – or lack thereof.  So if you want to guarantee results your best bet is to spend time with the science of recovery.

Maybe all you need is a little sunshine. You know, it seems that America has a growing depression problem. Psychologist John Huber says a simple lack of sunlight could be the trouble for some people.

Dr. Huber:  ""Getting sunlight is very significant. In fact, uh study done recently by Blue Cross Blue Shield said there was an increase in every state except for Hawaii for the percentage of depression that we have out there.  It may be the main cause right there.""

Mark Nuce: And he says the Seattle area is one of the worst for depression probably because it's cloudy and rainy all the time, but Dr. Huber says don't be fooled. Sunlight can't help everybody. There are lots of causes for depression. 

Dr. Huber: ""We experience it for different reasons. The significant loss of a loved one or something like that as well as just the neurochemical problem that people think of as the mental health issue.""

Mark Nuce: And he also says, 

Dr. Huber: ""Being angry at the world for different things. That's one of the theories behind it. Another theory behind it is that there is disalignment of your neuro chemical transmitters in your brain serotonin, norepinephrine and or dopamine.""

AAA is leading an effort to modernize Ohio’s young driver licensing system through supporting HB 293, the “Young Driver Protection Bill,” sponsored by Reps. Gary Scherer (R) and Michael Sheehy (D). The bill would make Ohio’s roads safer by giving teen drivers more experience behind the wheel through two small, but important adjustments to Ohio’s current licensing system:

Lengthening the Temporary Instruction Permit phase from six to 12 months.
Beginning supervised nighttime driving protections for novice teen drivers at 10 p.m., rather than midnight. (This is not a curfew – instead, supervised nighttime driving.)

Tom Nikkola Audio Articles,"No time to read the articles at tomnikkola.com? No problem! I'll read them to you. Listen to my candid perspective on nutrition, fitness, essential oils, supplements, behavior change, and more. I hardly notice the guy behind me, grunting like he's having an orgasm.
 
 
 
 Instead, I'm zoned in on the second hand of my stopwatch. It’s like a one-direction metronome. Tick, tick, tick.
 
 
 
 A text notification pops up on my phone screen and I quickly wipe it away without looking at who it's from.
 
 
 
 Tick, tick, tick.
 
 
 
 From the corner of my eye I catch a lady doing some movement she must have seen from a Jane Fonda video. “That’s not going to do anything. Eyes on the clock,” I think. 
 
 
 
 Tick, tick, tick.
 
 
 
 Whenever my mind wanders, I draw it back to the stopwatch.
 
 
 
 I programmed this block of VIGOR Strength Athlete with 30 second rest periods, and lots and lots of sets. 
 
 
 
 I find myself cherishing every second of my rest periods, never feeling like they're long enough.
 
 
 
 Though I don't often include such short rest periods in the training program, I did so in this training block for a few reasons:
 
 
 
 * To increase muscular stress by keeping rest periods short enough that you don't fully recover before the next set* To use lighter training loads light enough to give joints and the nervous system a break (we worked them pretty hard in previous training blocks)* To improve physical stamina and “staying power” by doing much more work in each session than usual 
 
 
 
 I planned these short rest periods specifically for the phyical benefits.
 
 
 
 I wasn’t expecting the mental effects, including better focus, reduced stress, and mental refreshment.
 
 
 
 Multitasking My Training Sessions
 
 
 
 Several years ago, I developed a bad workout habit. It isn’t as dumb as drinking beer before a workout, or smoking cigarettes after. But, it’s dumb nonetheless.
 
 
 
 In an attempt to be more productive during my rest periods between sets, I’d answer emails, respond to comments on Facebook, reply to text messages, research topics for articles, or even knock out a few sentences of blog post drafts.
 
 
 
 I thought I was more productive, making use of every nook and cranny in my daily calendar. And while I might have made a tiny bit of progress in my to-do list, multitasking during my training sessions affected me my mental outlook in a way I didn’t understand until recently.
 
 
 
 You know how silent it seems when you sit in your car after being at a concert? You don’t realize how loud it was until you sit in your car in silence.
 
 
 
 I didn’t realize how frazzled I felt following my workouts until I finished my workouts without feeling frazzled. My recent training sessions, with only 30 seconds to rest, didn’t allow me to multitask. And by eliminating the multitasking, I no longer felt frazzled.
 
 
 
 It reminded me of a book I read least year, Deep Work by Cal Newport. I remembered reading about Newport’s explanation of task switching and attention residue.
 
 
 
 Task-Switching and Attention Residue
 
 
 
 Task-switching is the mental and physical act of turning your attention from one topic, activity, or problem, to another. 
 
 
 
 In my case, I’d focus all my attention on executing an exercise, and then 15 seconds later turn my attention to a work-related task. Two minutes later, I’d try to mentally let go of whatever I was working on, Judging by its recent popularity, you might think the health benefits of collagen are new discoveries. However, an original ""girl boss"" named Hildegard of Bingen first wrote of the pain-relieving effects of collagen in 1175.
 
 
 
 Living in medieval Germany, St. Hildegard was a Benedictine abbess and polymath. She was a writer, composer, philosopher, and Christian mystic. Not surprisingly, she was pretty smart when it came to holistic medicine too.
 
 
 
 I imagine her looking at a pot of stew that had cooled, wondering if the fatty gel that sat on top of the stew had any health benefits. Maybe she scooped it off and ate it. And after repeating for long enough, perhaps she noticed a difference in how her joints felt. Who knows...
 
 
 
 At the impressive age of 77 years old, she wrote about the pain-relieving benefits of collagen. She lived another four years. Living to 81 years old was pretty impressive back then.
 
 
 
 But enough about St. Hildegard of Bingen. Let's get into the health benefits of collagen.
 
 
 
 Over the last several years, collagen has become one of the most popular nutritional supplements.
 
 
 
 How did this waste product of meat, poultry, and fish processing become an anti-aging, injury-healing, joint health-inducing superstar?
 
 
 
 What is collagen? What should you look for when buying a collagen supplement, and how does it fit in with your high-protein diet?
 
 
 
 Read on and find out.
 
 
 
 What is Collagen?
 
 
 
 Collagen provides a scaffolding for most of the tissues in your body. It connects muscle to bone and bone to bone, while also building cartilage that lets your bones slide over one another without causing pain in your joints. It keeps your organs in place...for that matter, it keeps your face in place too. 
 
 
 
 It isn’t as hard as bone, but is stronger than muscle tissue due to its amino acid structure.
 
 
 
 Collagen makes up about 30% of the total protein mass in the body, and 70% of the dry weight of the skin dermis.
 
 
 
 As you age, collagen breaks down. Exercise and overuse can also cause collagen breakdown. Collagen breakdown can lead to connective tissue injuries like torn bicep tendons or Achilles tendons, loss of joint cartilage, saggy skin, wrinkles, and cellulite.
 
 
 
 Anti-aging doctors have been injecting collagen into patients' faces for quite some time, in hopes of restoring their youth. 
 
 
 
 As you age, you lose collagen, making your face droop and your lips get smaller. You've probably seen at least one celebrity who's taken their collagen treatment to an extreme.
 
 
 
 Though it may not produce an immediate effect, it's possible you could look and feel younger by consuming, instead of injecting collagen.
 
 
 
 Eating Collagen Helps You Grow Collagen
 
 
 
 In case you need another reason to get off the vegan bandwagon, you only get collagen by eating collagen. 
 
 
 
 Meat has collagen. Mushrooms don’t.
 
 
 
 Poultry has collagen. Peanuts and potatoes don’t.
 
 
 
 Fish has collagen. Fava beans don’t.
 
 
 
 If you want the benefits of collagen, you’ll need to eat or supplement with collagen. There’s no plant on the planet that contains collagen.
 
 
 
 That said, even meat-eaters often miss their opportunity to consume collagen in everyday meals. Chewing tendons, bones, and skin isn’t that appealing, It's a common question, especially in the fall. Although the majority of people I know don't get the flu shot, across the population, that's more the exception than the rule.
 
 
 
 It shouldn't be surprising that most opt in for the vaccine. Advertisements, commercials, and signs make you think it's ""just what you do"" in October.
 
 
 
 I was recently in line at the pharmacy, waiting to pick up my prescription for Armour thyroid. 
 
 
 
 Being at the back of the line, I stood next to the hand sanitizer dispenser. That stuff you slather on your hands that's supposed to kill 99.99% of viruses and bacteria. When I got to the front of the line, I was offered to get a shot that put some of those viruses in my body that the hand sanitizer was supposed to kill. Modern-day medical irony.
 
 
 
 I skipped both options. But it got me thinking about the flu shot and the fact that I haven't addressed it in an article before. I'm often asked why I choose not to get the vaccine, but hadn't put my thoughts on virtual paper to address it.
 
 
 
 If you're for, against, or a fence-sitter when it comes to the flu shot, I hope this article gives you some stuff to think about, to lead to other conversations, and in the end, to help you make your own, informed decision rather than following the herd.
 
 
 
 Here's a couple of questions to help open your mind. I'm not going to answer them. I'm just going to open with them:
 
 
 
 * Why are people so quick to jump on board with getting a flu shot, or having their kids get it, when there's barely any long-term research to show it won't have side effects?* Why are some of those same people so quick to question the safety of natural health products that have been safely used for thousands of years?
 
 
 
 Perplexing, isn't it?
 
 
 
 Influenza-Like Illness vs Influenza
 
 
 
 More than 200 viruses can cause Influenza-Like Illness (ILI). As the name suggests, ILI causes flu-like symptoms without being caused by the influenza virus.
 
 
 
 Symptoms of Influenza-Like Illness include:
 
 
 
 * Runny nose* Cough* Aches* Headache* Fever* Fatigue and weakness* Sore throat
 
 
 
 More than likely, when you were a kid, your parents let you skip a day of school where you laid under a blanket on the couch, drank Sprite, and watched boring daytime TV. Once in a while, you'd get a second day off of school, but most of the time, you were well enough the next day to go back to school.
 
 
 
 Getting the flu was unfortunate, but not surprising. It just happens, and most of the time, it's no big deal. Today, it's become a big deal in part because there's money to be made, but I won't go there in this article. Maybe another time.
 
 
 
 So, the fall is flu season. Sometimes you get ""the flu"" from the influenza virus. Sometimes you get ""the flu"" from something else.
 
 
 
 Of those who experience influenza-like illness, only 7-15% of cases are caused by influenza viruses.
 
 
 
 The flu vaccine targets those 7-15% of cases caused by the influenza virus. 
 
 
 
 How Does the Flu Vaccine Work?
 
 
 
 You might think the flu shot gives you some sort of superpower to combat the flu. That’s not how it works.
 
 
 
 The flu shot doesn’t guarantee you’ll avoid the flu. It reduces the likelihood you'll get it, if you're exposed to the same strain the vaccine was designed for.
 
 
 
 When someone says, ""I've gotten the flu shot for 10 years in a row and I haven't gotten the flu one time, Which is the best diet for building a long-living, lean, fit body; low-carb, keto, low-fat, or high-protein?
 
 
 
 If you're looking for the short answer, it's a high-protein diet.
 
 
 
 Does that mean low-fat or low-carb diets never work? Not necessarily. 
 
 
 
 In this article, I'll explain a little of the pros and cons of each diet. By the end, you should be able to see why a high-protein diet is the way to go for almost everyone.
 
 
 
 Before getting to the diets, though, I need to address some basic nutrition science, and tackle the topic of why ""calories in, calories out"" isn't as simple as your smartphone app would have you believe it to be.
 
 
 
 Calories, Macronutrients, Basic Math
 
 
 
 Obviously, the foods we eat contain calories. You see them posted on packages, restaurant menus, and alcohol bottles. When it’s not labeled, you can find it online.
 
 
 
 We’ve grown to love the idea of counting calories because…well, we can count them. Not accurately, but we’ve been led to believe we can count them with a reasonable amount of accuracy.
 
 
 
 We know that our love handles, saddle bags, and double chins are storage pouches of the calories we ate but didn’t need. And we believe that the way we get rid of them is to simply eat fewer calories.
 
 
 
 To a certain extent, it does work. 
 
 
 
 When I was 15 years old, my ski jumping coach told me I needed to lose weight in order to be more competitive. I knew about calorie counts back then, so I decided to eat no more than 500 calories per day.
 
 
 
 I filled up on diet pop and soda water, ate a few ounces of lunch meat each day and some vegetables, and once a week I went to the convenience store so I could splurge on salsa sandwiches.
 
 
 
 Within a few months, I dropped my 5’10”, 154 lb frame down to 137 lbs. 
 
 
 
 I looked more like a meth addict than a ski jumper, but the scale said I did a good job with my diet.
 
 
 
 Oh, in case you’re judging my parents, I lived in a dorm at Northern Michigan University, where they had an Olympic Training Center for ski jumping, for my junior year of high school. My parents were horrified the first time they saw me after my “successful” weight loss at a ski jumping tournament.
 
 
 
 And herein lies one of the biggest problems about using only calories as a means of weight loss. 
 
 
 
 You lose as much muscle as you lose body fat. 
 
 
 
 And at an extreme, you can cause significant damage to your metabolism, such as diet-induced hypothyroidism.
 
 
 
 The Flaws In Calories In, Calories Out
 
 
 
 At an extreme, like my 500 calorie diet, you can lose weight. It’s a dumb way to do it, but it’s possible.
 
 
 
 More often, though, people are encouraged to follow a long-term, chronically restricted diet to “slowly” lose weight.
 
 
 
 This is just as bad as my asinine anorexic method. But, probably more frustrating because you live in constant deprivation, but don’t see any results from your efforts.
 
 
 
 We’ve been sold the idea that weight loss and weight gain is just about calories for decades now. It goes something like this:
 
 
 
 A pound of fat contains 3500 calories. Therefore, to lose a pound per week of body fat, you just need to eat 500 calories per day fewer than you burn.
 
 
 
 In business, this is called spreadsheet math. Spreadsheet math doesn’t account for any variables outside of the simple formula put into the spreadsh... There are no good reasons to eat gluten. There are numerous reasons to avoid gluten-containing foods. This includes babies as much as it includes adults.
 
 
 
 Yet, parents are often encouraged to give their kids cereal once they start eating whole foods. Perhaps, these findings from The Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) will help you rethink eating it, or at least recommending it for young children.
 
 
 
 Based on results of studying more than 80,000 children, researchers in Norway found that gluten consumption at 18 months of age dramatically increased the risk of developing Type I diabetes.
 
 
 
 Type I vs Type II Diabetes
 
 
 
 Type I diabetes doesn’t get as much attention as type II. Of the roughly 23 million people in the US, diagnosed with diabetes in 2016, just under 6% were diagnosed with Type I, while 91% were diagnosed with Type II. The remaining were diagnosed with other types of diabetes.
 
 
 
 Type II Diabetes
 
 
 
 Type II diabetes is largely preventable, and often curable, as it’s more of a lifestyle and diet related disease. Muscle loss from a lack of exercise, and excessive carbohydrate consumption are the main causes of Type II diabetes. 
 
 
 
 Intense strength training and carbohydrate restriction, along with supplementation and/or medication can often reduce or eliminate the severity of type II diabetes. At least, it can be resolved if it isn’t so severe that the type II diabetic has totally worn down his or her pancreas.
 
 
 
 Type I Diabetes
 
 
 
 Type I diabetes is an autoimmune condition, though. The body’s immune system perceives the beta cells of the pancreas as a pathogen and attacks them. 
 
 
 
 Without functioning beta cells, the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and the body cannot regulate blood sugar. 
 
 
 
 It isn’t a death sentence, as type I diabetics can inject insulin each day to keep blood sugar in check. However, blood sugar does need to be closely monitored throughout the day, and the diet of a type I diabetic needs to be closely managed.
 
 
 
 Type I Diabetes, Babies, and Gluten
 
 
 
 Type II diabetes isn’t something that happens overnight. It usually takes years of poor diet and lifestyle choices. During that time, people often ignore the signs, such as rising blood sugar levels or insulin resistance, body fat gain, fluctuating energy levels, and other symptoms.
 
 
 
 However, the effects of type I diabetes can occur much faster, and are more significant. Especially when a child develops type I diabetes. It’s not like he or she knows enough to say, “Mom, Dad, I don’t feel right.”
 
 
 
 So, I hope this finding from the research study I mentioned above sends a clear message to parents considering giving their kids gluten-containing foods:
 
 
 
 For every 10 grams of gluten consumed per day at 18 months of age, the risk of developing Type I Diabetes later in life increases 46%.
 
 
 
 The researchers found the average child at 18 months consumed almost 9 grams of gluten each day. Of course, with averages, that means some kids are consuming much more. Scary!
 
 
 
 More Than Just Gluten One in three people sleep less than seven hours each night. One in three people are obese. There might be a connection there.
 
 
 
 Although everyone who’s overweight or obese isn’t sleep-deprived, and some people who are sleep-deprived might stay skinny, sleep definitely plays a role on body composition for most of us.
 
 
 
 A new study shows sleep debt causes you to store more fat, even when your diet remains unchanged. It also leaves you less satisfied from your meals, which could cause you to eat more than you need.
 
 
 
 On top of that, a second study just published shows that sleep debt isn’t just a problem for adults. It shed more light on the impact it has on adolescents, especially girls.
 
 
 
 I’ll touch on these recent findings below, but if you want a more in-depth article on the importance of sleep, and how to improve sleep quality and quantity, check out my article Sleep: The Ultimate Guide For Your Health. 
 
 
 
 Not surprisingly, it's one of the three synergistic health habits I discuss in my ebook, The First 3 Habits of VIGOR(ESS) Health.
 
 
 
 Short-Term Sleep Debt, Body Fat, and Satiety
 
 
 
 The first study looked at the impact of sleep debt during a typical workweek.
 
 
 
 Prior to beginning the study, fifteen healthy, young men spent a week at home, getting 10 hours in bed each night.
 
 
 
 Note: The researchers could only account for time in bed (TIB), not for actual hours slept, to run the study. That’s why I use the usual phrase “time in bed” instead of hours slept.
 
 
 
 Then, they checked into the sleep lab, where they got 10 hours of time in bed for another three nights. That's 10 days in a row with 10 hours in bed. You might be wondering, ""How can I get in on one of these studies?! Ten hours would be amazing!""
 
 
 
 Following their first three nights at the sleep lab, they were restricted to just five hours of time in bed for five nights in a row, similar to the lifestyle many Americans live each week. After those five nights of sleep restriction, they got two more nights of 10 hours time in bed to see if they recovered.
 
 
 
 Rather than looking at the impact the sleep debt had on breakfast the next morning, which is what most research has already reviewed, this group wanted to look at the impact of sleep debt on dinner, the biggest meal of the day for most people.
 
 
 
 Dinner remained the same on all nights, including the nights they got 10 hours of bedtime. So, the only difference in everything was the time in bed.
 
 
 
 The participants blood sugar fluctuations were the same after the nights with 10 hours or five hours of sleep. But their insulin levels were higher on the days following their shortened sleep. 
 
 
 
 Without a change in blood sugar, insulin levels increased. Insulin increases fat storage, which the researchers saw based on the lab work they performed.
 
 
 
 In essence, the simple act of restricting sleep caused the participants to store more fat. On top of that, they felt less satisfied from the meals they ate. Given the opportunity to eat more, they probably would have. And, had they eaten more, based on their insulin levels, they would have stored more energy as fat.
 
 
 
 This explains why people can get fatter without a change in diet, or why they can’t lose weight if they try to diet while in sleep debt."

The TotalSelf Considered,"Wouldn't it be great to tap into the minds of top professionals for insights on improving your emotional and physical well-being? I'm Jeff Fine, a psychotherapist, fitness coach, and nutritionist, and I launched this podcast to share the latest thinking and best practices with everyone interested in bringing positive change to their lives. In each episode, I interview a professional from a different discipline such as psychotherapists, fitness pros, acupuncturists, nutritionists, psychiatrists, and physical therapists. We discuss tools and strategies that can help you overcome whatever obstacles are preventing you from enjoying your life and creating your best self. Listeners who want to find out more can visit my website https://mytotalself.com/ When we’re injured we want answers. We want someone to tell us what is wrong and what to do about it. Yet all too often, people in pain find themselves on the medical merry-go-round. They go to multiple doctors and other providers only to find that their pain remains unchanged or worsens. And because pain causes not just physical but also emotional suffering (hopelessness, despair, and frustration), sometimes people stop trying to find new ways to heal.

The good news is that yoga, though familiar to many in our culture but rarely viewed as a viable modality to treat and manage injuries and pain, may be just what the doctor didn’t order! The number of options when deciding what to include in your exercise program can get overwhelming: functional movement, body weight exercises, strength training, cardio, yoga, pilates, crossfit… As a result, Why do so many couples fight about the same things over and over? What are the obstacles to sending clear emotional signals that allow partners to respond to each other with empathy and compassion? How can partners learn to work together to defeat the common enemy in their relationship, the negative cycle?

In this episode of The Total Self Considered, Jeff Fine interviews Wendy Tomkiel, a certified EFT therapist and supervisor who is also trained in AEDP (Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy), and ISTDP (Intensive Short Term Dynamic Therapy). Wendy and Jeff breakdown the anatomy of a couple’s fight, by explaining the primal wiring that all humans have, and the ways attachment needs shape our reactions to each other. Through typical examples of negative cycles, they pinpoint how EFT helps couples slow down enough to see their own movements in a cycle, and access more options when they start to fall into old patterns. In this episode of the TotalSelf Considered, Jeff Fine interviews Erika Muraski, physical therapist extra-ordinaire. Erika was a competitive ice-skater until she had a career ending injury. She had always wanted to be a physical therapist and the experience of getting hurt and having to give up the sport she loved has made her highly attuned and compassionate to the needs of her patients.



Jeff and Erika discuss back pain and treatment approaches from multiple perspectives: first, Erika explains the physical structure of the spine and surrounding soft tissue, and the related “mechanical” issues or imbalances that can lead to back pain. After going over the symptoms of various types of back pain, and when one should seek medical attention, Jeff and Erika delve into the impact of lifestyle factors, particularly the role that our sedentary lifestyles and stress have for so many of us experiencing back pain.



There’s an overwhelming amount of recommendations out there to reduce back pain – core strengthening, zero drop shoes, standing desks, stretching, ice, heat, doing more, doing less, laser therapy – but which of these actually help? Listen to the episode to find out. In this episode of The Total Self Considered, Jeff Fine interviews Dr Scott Hirsch, a clinical associate professor in the Departments of both Neurology and Psychiatry, as well as Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at NYU Langone. Dr Hirsch shares his insights on our current understanding of mental illness and medications used for treatment, including medical marijuana. As a practitioner who has been exploring the mind-body connection for many years, Jeff is very interested in how Dr Hirsch integrates psychiatry and neurology in his practice. They discuss the distinction between neurologically based disorders and other conditions, how the brain and mind interact, how medications work in treating epilepsy, depression, anxiety and other issues, and the role medical marijuana can play in treating certain disorders and opioid addiction. In this episode of The Total Self Considered, Jeff Fine interviews Dr Laurie Freeman,

a licensed psychologist, certified Emotionally Focused Couples Therapist/Supervisor (EFT), and

a certified Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapist (AEDP).

Jeff and Laurie breakdown how this approach works and discuss why the outcomes after

therapy are consistently positive. They also present a vignette of a distressed couple going

through a series of agonizing negative interactions, explain the dynamics and patterns

underneath, and highlight how EFT can help the partners to resolve their underlying issues."

Transformation Physique,"Obtiens enfin un corps à ta hauteur grâce aux nombreux conseils nutrition et fitness de ce podcast. La perte de poids et la prise de muscles n'auront plus de secrets pour toi.Abonnez-vous pour ne rater aucun épisodes Aujourd’hui je vais te présenter un objet complètement sous-estimé dans les salles de musculation. C’est simple, personne ne l’utilise et pourtant, que dirais-tu si je te disais qu’un simple carnet de musculation a le pouvoir de décupler ta progression ? Tu me prendrais surement pour un charlatan mais laisse-moi au moins t’expliquer pourquoi selon moi ce carnet d’entrainement est indispensable et est largement sous-coté.







Si tu n’aimes pas lire, cet article existe aussi en version audio 😉 Clique sur “Play” pour l’écouter ou clique-ici pour le télécharger







   















1-     Carnet de musculation comme aide mémoire







Si comme moi tu as une mémoire de poisson rouge alors ce carnet est fait pour toi. Au début j’oubliai l’ordre des exercices et les poids que j’avais utilisé à la séance précédente. Le problème c’est que je perdais donc du temps pour m’en souvenir et il se pouvait même que je n’utilise pas les bons poids. Donc autant te dire que ces séances n’étaient pas très bonnes. C’est un problème récurrent que je vois en salle, les pratiquants de musculation débutants passent un temps fou entre les exercices pour se souvenir du prochain exercice et ne savent jamais quel poids ils doivent mettre.







2-    

Ta séance est plus efficace







Le carnet de musculation te permet de structurer ton entrainement. Tu as déterminé à l’avance quelle sera ta séance, tes exercices, temps de pause, nombre de séries… Il n’y a donc plus de place au hasard et tu sais donc parfaitement ce que tu as à faire. Tu ne perds pas de temps pendant ta séance et elle devient vraiment efficace pour prendre de la masse musculaire. Beaucoup trop de gens papillonnent pendant leur séance car ils n’ont pas de structure définie et le résultat est qu’ils ne progressent pas.







3-     Tu peux suivre facilement ta progression















Quelle a été ta performance à ton entrainement il y a un mois ? Tu t’en souviens ? Il y a de fortes chances pour que ça ne soit pas le cas. Une règle fondamentale quand on cherche à prendre du muscle, c’est de toujours chercher à progresser à l’entrainement. C’est aussi fondamental quand tu fais une sèche de savoir si tes performances ne chutent pas pour être certain de ne pas perdre de muscle. Mais comment tu sais que tu as progressé si tu ne te souviens pas de tes séances précédentes ? Il est donc important de noter dans ton carnet de musculation les charges utilisées, le nombre de répétitions et de séries. Ainsi tu peux reprendre n’importe quelle séance et voir si tu fais mieux maintenant. Tu peux en plus avoir des graphiques sur certaines applications mobiles ou avec une version excel.







4-     Il sert de souvenir







Au bout de plusieurs

années d’entrainement tu en auras rempli des carnets de musculation, crois-moi. Je te conseille de les garder

précieusement, tu pourras les ressortir au bout de quelques années. C’est un

bon moyen de se souvenir de tes débuts et de te rendre compte de tout le chemin

parcouru.







5-     C’est motivant Dans le milieu sportif, et particulièrement dans la musculation, il est courant de faire une sèche mais si tu es débutant, tu peux trouver ce terme un peu étrange. Non ça n’a rien à voir avec le fait de sécher les cours de sport ou de sécher au soleil après la douche. Tu peux voir ça un peu comme un régime minceur dont l’objectif est de perdre du poids mais pas n’importe comment. Quand on fait une sèche on cherche à perdre efficacement du gras et à préserver sa masse musculaire (ba oui c’est quand même utile les muscles, il vaut mieux les garder). Je vais donc te donner ici toute la méthode pour faire une bonne sèche en perdant efficacement un maximum de gras tout en gardant un maximum de muscles.

Faire une sèche ou un régime ?















Dans l’introduction j’ai osé comparer la sèche au régime amincissant. Je vois déjà les puristes du bodybuilding me sauter dessus.

Effectivement ce n’est pas exactement la même chose et je vais donc te donner

la différence.







Initialement, le mot sèche

vient des compétitions de bodybuilding,

tu sais les gars extrêmement musclés

en slip qui se baladent sur scène (en vrai je kiff, chut ne me juge pas ok !).

Le but était de perdre le maximum de masse graisseuse possible en

évitant au maximum la fonte des muscles

pour pouvoir exposer leur musculature

le jour de la compétition. Leur but

n’est pas seulement d’être dessiné,

il est d’être découpé comme on dit.

Avec la démocratisation de la

musculation, ce terme de sèche a

aussi pris un sens plus large de perte

de poids, même si ça déplait aux puristes (il faut l’accepter les gars).







Ok mais du coup tu dois te dire que faire une sèche c’est comme faire

un régime. Et bien non toujours pas. Si on reprend la définition du

Larousse, un régime c’est une

« Conduite alimentaire caractérisée par des restrictions ». Mais bon

cette définition ne nous donne pas le but du régime, en effet il peut être multiple comme un régime vegan, sans gluten… Ton but ici avec un régime est la perte de poids

et c’est là le gros problème des régimes. 







Ok tu dois me prendre pour un fou, comment la perte de poids peut être un

problème ? Je t’explique.







Ton corps est

constitué de beaucoup de choses dont de la graisse

et du muscle. Ta perte de poids peut venir d’une perte de graisse comme d’une perte de muscle sauf que dans un régime on ne fait aucune distinction

entre les deux. C’est là, la grosse différence entre la sèche et le régime.

Dans un régime, perdre 5 Kg, que ce soit de la graisse

ou du muscle, c’est une réussite car

tu affiches 5 kg de moins sur la balance.

Alors que pour la sèche, perdre 5 Kg

de graisse est une réussite (bravo,

un bourrelet un moins) mais si c’est

5 kg de muscles elle est

complètement ratée.







Tu l’auras donc compris, je vois le régime comme une méthode aléatoire pour maigrir, affiner ton tour de

taille sans t’embêter mais avec le risque de garder le même corps flasque et sans énergie qu’avant, même avec les kilos (de muscle) en moins (si tu arrives à maigrir comme ça).







Faire une sèche

c’est donc une façon beaucoup plus réfléchie,

plus scientifique d’aborder la perte de poids. Ça nécessite un peu

plus d’efforts mais les résultats en valent large... Tu l’as surement remarqué, j’aime me lancer des défis. Ce que j’aime surtout c’est expérimenter des choses car les études scientifiques c’est bien mais il est aussi important d’expérimenter par soi même. C’est d’autant plus important pour moi car pour pouvoir te donner les meilleurs conseils, je dois savoir par quoi tu dois passer pour atteindre ton objectif. Je t’invite à participer avec moi à ce défi perte de poids même si tu ne fais pas de diète cétogène. Ce défi commence le 9 décembre 2019 et se terminera le 12 avril (le jour de mon anniversaire).

Diète cétogène: c’est quoi?







Le but d’une diète cétogène est de réduire l’apport en glucides et d’augmenter l’apport en lipides. Comme tu l’as vu dans l’article “tout comprendre sur les glucides“, les glucides permettent en gros au corps d’avoir du glucose pour servir de source d’énergie. Dans ce cas là, tu dois te demander quel est l’intérêt d’une diète cétogène si on supprime notre principale source d’énergie? En réalité, le corps est parfaitement capable de produire du glucose via d’autres nutriments que les glucides, c’est la néoglucogenèse. Le corps peut très bien utiliser les lipides comme source d’énergie via la création de corps cétoniques appelés aussi cétones.







Certains organes comme le cerveaux ne peuvent pas utiliser directement les lipides comme source d’énergie car les acides gras ne peuvent pas traverser la barrière hémato-encéphalique. Donc s’il n’y a pas beaucoup de glucose disponible, le foie produit des cétones à partir des acides gras pour fournir de l’énergie, ce qui peut représenter jusqu’à environ 75% de l’énergie du cerveau. Les cétones peuvent remplacer le glucose dans la majorité du corps. Les personnes pratiquants le jeûne connaissent bien les corps cétoniques vu qu’ils sont produits aussi pendant la privation de nourriture. Le corps produit constamment des corps cétoniques mais le but de la diète cétogène est d’entrer en cétose, c’est-à-dire d’augmenter la production de cétones.







Ok c’est bien beau tout ça mais c’est quoi le but? Mon défi c’est de perdre du poids et un des arguments de cette diète est que le corps devient une machine à brûler du gras vu qu’il utilise les acides gras comme énergie. En réalité, il n’y a pas de supériorité de cette diète par rapport aux autres sur la perte de gras. Certes avec cette diète le corps est une machine pour brûler les lipides venant de l’alimentation, mais ça ne veut pas dire qu’il va brûler plus de tissus adipeux, c’est le déficit calorique qui prédomine toujours. Par contre les pratiquants de cette diète remarquent des améliorations au niveau mental et du bien-être qu’on ne retrouve pas avec des régimes plus riches en glucides comme le montr... « Les secrets de la sèche : tout savoir sur la sèche et la perte de poids », un titre qui promet. Ce livre a été écrit par William Janssens et Christophe Bonnefont. William Janssen est physiologiste de l’exercice tandis que Christophe Bonnefont est préparateur physique et créateur de la marque « Anabolic Supplément » spécialisée dans les compléments alimentaires. Comme le titre le laisse deviner, c’est un livre sur la perte de poids et plus particulièrement dans le cadre de la pratique sportive telle que la musculation. Il nous promet une perte de graisse durable donc sans l’effet yo-yo des régimes traditionnels. Que vaut vraiment ce livre, existe-il vraiment des secrets pour perdre de la graisse ? C’est ce que nous allons voir dans cet article.

Les 10 piliers de la perte de graisse







Ce chapitre nous expose les grands principes de la perte de poids.







1- L’équilibre énergétique















Pour nous expliquer ce concept, les auteurs utilisent un exemple très intéressant en faisant le parallèle avec un compte bancaire. Si on dépense plus d’argent que ce qui arrive sur le compte alors notre capital diminue et inversement. Le corps fonctionne de la même façon. Si on lui apporte plus de calories qu’il n’en dépense alors il va les stocker sous forme de graisse. Le corps n’est pas regardant sur leur provenance, que ces calories viennent des lipides, glucides, protéines, l’alcool, toutes peuvent être stockées sous forme de graisse.







Pour perdre du tissu adipeux (du gras), il faut commencer par déterminer la quantité de calories dont le corps à besoin en prenant en compte deux éléments. Le premier est le taux métabolique basal qui est la quantité de calories dont le corps a besoin pour rester en vie. Il dépend de nombreux éléments comme l’age, le sexe, le taux de masse grasse… Puis il faut le multiplier par un facteur d’activité PAL (Phyical activity Level). “Vous êtes fous d’avaler ça” est un livre écrit par Christophe Brusset. Il a passé plus de vingt ans dans l’industrie agroalimentaire et a fait de nombreux métiers dans le domaine. Il connaît donc sur le bout des doigts l’industrie agroalimentaire et nous donne son témoignage à travers ce livre. Ce livre c’est du lourd, même du très très lourd. Ce que révèle “Vous êtes fous d’avaler ça” fait froid dans le dos et je pense sincèrement qu’il devrait être lu par tous. Dans cet article je vais donc t’exposer quelques anecdotes du livre alors accroche-toi et essaie de ne pas vomir en lisant ces lignes.

Qui est Christophe Brusset

Christophe Brusset a passé plus de 20 ans dans cette industrie de l’agroalimentaire et a pratiqué différents métiers. Il a commencé comme ingénieur puis acheteur et négociateur (trader) et enfin directeur des achats. Il a donc lui-même acheté et revendu un grand nombre de produits alimentaires et emballages. Il a tenté plusieurs entreprises mais il s’est aperçu qu’elles fonctionnaient toutes de la même façon.

A la suite du scandale des lasagnes à la viande de cheval à la place de bœuf, il a décidé de démissionner et de témoigner sur cette industrie.

Vous êtes fous d’avaler ça, de la daube chinoise dans nos assiettes

Bon on ne va pas se mentir, une bonne majorité des produits complètement impropres à la consommation mais qui finissent quand même dans nos assiettes, viennent de Chine. C’est ce que va nous montrer Christophe tout au long du livre avec ses nombreuses anecdotes.

Le livre commence par une énumération des scandales alimentaires chinois. L’un d’eux est la présence de mélamine dans le lait. La mélamine est une substance très toxique qui a de graves conséquences sur la santé. Elle était ajoutée au lait pour augmenter artificiellement le taux d’azote et donc tromper les analyses sur le niveau de protéines qui était évalué plus élevé qu’il ne l’était en réalité. La majorité des produits laitiers chinois étaient contaminées, même le lait maternisé.

Mais ce n’est pas le seul scandale:



* De la peinture toxique ajoutée à des pains

* De l’huile d’égout recyclé en huile de table

* Des choux traités au formol

* De la viande de rat à la place de boeuf

* etc…



Et bien sûr ces produits ne sont pas sagement restés en Chine, nous n’avons pas été épargné non plus.

Vous avez dit produits locaux?



Le but des ces entreprises de l’agroalimentaire est de faire du profit et pour cela tous les moyens sont bons, même si ça doit nuire à la santé du consommateur.

Le mensonge et la triche font partie du jeu. Un mensonge souvent utilisé par les grandes surfaces est celui de la provenance du produit. L’exemple des escargots de Bourgogne est frappant. L’appellation “De bourgogne” désigne une espèce et non pas un lieu donc ils peuvent venir de Pologne, Russie …

Christophe nous raconte ensuite sa visite d’une usine d’escargot en Turquie. Dans cette usine les coquilles restaient en plein soleil, nettoyées par les mouches, les vers et autres insectes. Elles étaient ensuite plongées dans de la soude caustique, rincées puis garnies pour finir dans nos assiettes. Miam ça donne envie.

Tout est mis en place pour faire croire au consommateur qu’il consomme un produit français, un produit du terroir. L’emballage, le nom de la marque et du produit, le “transformé en france“… Il suff... Tout comme le saint Graal, beaucoup se sont lancés à la recherche des abdominaux en vain. Le célèbre 6 pack, fait fantasmer beaucoup de monde. De nombreux aventuriers se sont lancés dans l’aventure mais ont fini par renoncer devant une tâche aussi ardue. Certaines personnes, très minces, pensent avoir atteint ce but ultime des abdominaux dessinés, mais ce n’est qu’une illusion. De vrais abdominaux doivent être épais et fort. Je vais te révéler dans cet article tout ce qu’il faut savoir pour créer une séance abdo efficace pour obtenir des abdominaux biens dessinés.

Les abdominaux ça sert à quoi ?

Avant de rentrer dans les cœurs du sujet, il faut comprendre l’anatomie des abdominaux et leurs fonctions pour pouvoir créer une séance abdo optimale.

La sangle abdominale comprend 4 muscles :



* L’oblique Externe

* L’oblique interne

* Le droit de l’abdomen (le six pack)

* Le transverse



L’oblique externe démarre sur la partie osseuse des côtes K5 à K12 et les deux obliques se rejoignent par une aponévrose (une zone tendineuse) au centre de l’abdomen. Au milieu de cette aponévrose il y a ce qu’on appelle la ligne blanche, c’est la ligne verticale que tu vois au milieu de tes abdominaux. Il s’insère aussi au niveau du bassin sur la crête iliaque. Les fibres sont obliques et vers le bas.

L’oblique interne est sous l’oblique externe. Il s’attache sur les côtes K9 à K12 ainsi que sur la crête iliaque. Les deux obliques internes se rejoignent aussi via une aponévrose. Les fibres ont une direction opposée aux obliques externes. Les obliques internes et externes travaillent en synergie. Ils permettent la flexion du buste sur le côté mais aussi la rotation du buste.

Le droit de l’abdomen est au centre, sous l’aponévrose des obliques. Il s’insère au niveau des côtes et du sternum d’un côté et le pubis de l’autre. Les fibres sont donc verticales. Le droit de l’abdomen est entrecoupé de lignes tendineuses qui définissent le nombre d’abdominaux. De par le sens des fibres on comprend que les abdominaux permettent la flexion du buste vers le bassin mais aussi du bassin vers le buste. Son rôle est aussi d’éviter une sur-extension de la colonne.

Sous tout ça on trouve le transverse qui s’insère sur les 5 dernières vertèbres lombaires et vient entourer les viscères. Il se finit par une aponévrose sur le devant de l’abdomen. Le transverse agit véritablement comme une gaine en évitant que les viscères ne partent en avant. Nous parlerons du transverse dans un autre article.

Mais au-delà d’un aspect esthétique, le travail de la sangle abdominal permet une meilleure stabilisation de la colonne vertébrale et donc de protéger le dos. Ils permettent aussi de stabiliser le bassin et de maintenir la posture. Une bonne sangle abdominale permet d’améliorer les performances car elle permet un transfert de force entre les membres du bas et ceux du haut.

Les différences morphologiques

Tu l’auras sûrement remarqué, tout le monde n’a pas le même nombre ou la même forme d’abdominaux.

Certains ont 6 abdominaux, d’autres 8 abdominaux (les kings du fitgame) et d’autres sont moins chanceux et n’ont que 4 abdominaux. Tu peux voir tourner sur les réseaux sociaux et internet des séance abdo pour avoir 4, 6 ou 8 abdominaux."

Finished high school in Tokyo and moved to the US to attend college. 

I didn’t plan for it initially, but I ended up going to medical school &amp; got a job in Los Angeles. Now I’m married and with a dog... so I’m happily stuck in Los Angeles. 

As for the athletics, I was an avid soccer player &amp; coach; but it got harder to find a team to play for. I started dabbling in cycling, which led me to dabble in triathlon and eventually an Ironman races. 

After getting married in 2017 and doing the Ironman Canada a week later (and missing out on Kona championship slot), I decided to focus on marathon. I BQed and ran Boston in 2019. Now I’m chasing my first sub 3 marathon and eventually hope to run 6 major marathons. 

I’m an attending foot and ankle surgeon at the cedars Sinai medical center. I train and mentor 4 residents &amp; I have a private practice in Los Angeles, 0.5 miles away from the Cedars campus. I see some of my fellow runners in my clinic for sports injuries. 

My specialty is wound care, which is mostly older and chronically ill people with bed sores, burns and diabetic foot wounds. 

I am a Buddhist and I’ve been a “vegetarian” my whole life. I became a vegan about 3-4 years ago &amp; lost weight and feel great than ever.  I live in a little house with a big yard in Manhattan Beach with my husband Mike, human child Nate, and the fur kids, Dexter (sweet old chocolate Lab) and Hawkeye (crazy orange tabby cat). Nate is 18 and attending El Camino College. My dad was in the Navy when I was little, so we moved around quite a bit, but I mostly grew up in the Washington, DC area, and then went to college in Vermont. After college, a friend and I drove across the country to live in LA, pretty much on a whim. I’ve now lived here over 30 years!
 
 I work as an operations supervisor for a large printing company in Torrance. I do financial forecasting, budgeting, and analysis, hiring and firing, fun stuff like that! Which is very weird because I majored in art &amp; literature in college. Go figure.
 
 I am a homebody. I like napping, reading, and watching cat videos. I also like cooking and eating. I’m vegan (not an angry vegan, a nice vegan LOL). My family loves baseball, and we have a goal to visit all 30 major league ballparks together, a few each year. We’ll get to 23 this year. It’s been great, since we’ve ended up visiting lots of cities we’d never have seen otherwise. Writer and Certified Coach, Level Two for both, USA Track and Field and USA Triathlon; and Level One, Certified Coach, Road Runners Club of America. 

David A. Levine, is co-author of the Complete Idiots Guide to Marathon Training, which came out worldwide in 2012.  Runner’s World Magazine has quoted him.  He is a certified Coach, Level Two, with USA Track &amp; Field and Level Two with USA Triathlon, both signatories of the US Olympic Committee.  

Recently, he received his Level One Coaching Certification from Road Runners Club of America.  A three-time Ironman and twenty-seven time marathoner, Levine coached and organized the City Of Angels Half Marathon training group, now USA Marathon Training, for thirteen seasons, and ongoing.  

Most of the experienced runners in that group, and under his leadership, achieve a personal record (PR) with each major race.  For over fourteen years, he has been coaching weekly track workouts as Coach for the LA Running Club.  

With triathlon as a passion, Levine coached a Team-In-Training triathlon group, with similar positive results, and proudly helps his Sony Tri Team.   For nine seasons, he was a Pace Leader with the 1,600 member LA Roadrunners.  

There he helped on the coaching advisory committee, for the last two years he was there, ending in 2011.  He is currently on the Board of the South Bay Running Club (SBRC), the LA Running Club (LARC), and USA Marathon Training (USA MT).  

All three of which, he helped found, with others.  Levine has also been a published features writer for numerous publications, including magazine cover articles and newspapers. Jasmine Moezzi is a 25 year old Iranian-American Triathlete, Chronic Illness Warrior/Advocate, KEEN Los Angeles volunteer, and world traveler.

She was born and raised in Los Angeles and holds a B.S. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Southern California and is currently employed at Equinox Culver City.

She proudly represents Iracelikeagirl International Women's Team founded by her coach and biggest inspiration, Pro Triathlete Angela Naeth.

5 years ago before her senior year at USC, she lived abroad in Taiwan where things took a very unexpected turn. She became extremely ill with many debilitating symptoms for years to come, but she's never let her illness define her or stop her from living her life to the fullest.

To help her cope with the constant pain and discomfort from her illness, she decided to push her mind and body further than ever before by joining the USC Triathlon Team. Without knowing how to swim or bike properly and having minimal running experience, she dove right in and dedicated all her free time to training for her first triathlon. She slowly started seeing her progress and how much it was helping her mind and body cope with her illness, so she stuck with it and never looked back.

In 2016, she competed in Collegiate Regionals and qualified for USA Triathlon Collegiate Nationals in South Carolina. Shortly after, she completed her first Ironman 70.3 in Hawaii while raising over $8,000 for the Children's Tumor Foundation. Michael Weisberg considers running to be more than a passion, but a way of live. He ran his first 5K race when he was seven and ran track &amp; field through high school. 

After a lengthy hiatus and significant weight gain, Michael started training for his first marathon, the 2012 Los Angeles Marathon. In addition to losing 55 pounds in 8 months, he rekindled his love of running. Since then he has run 9 marathons and over 20 half-marathons.

 In a desire to give back to the running community, Michael is a co-founder and President of the South Bay Runners Club.  In just over 4 years, SBRC now has over 400 members of all abilities and all demographics.  He is an RRCA Certified Coach, senior pace leader for the LA Roadrunners (the official training program for the Los Angeles Marathon), and is on the race committee for the Manhattan Beach 10K, where he will be taking over as race director in 2020.

Michael ran his first Boston Marathon in April 2017, after qualifying at Mountains 2 Beach in May 2016. He has completed the US leg of the Abbott World Majors and is hoping to add some international marathons to his schedule.

Also the CCO of the South Bay Runners Clubs (that’s Chief Culinary Officer), Michael often brings homemade baked goods.  When not training with SBRC, he can usually be found spending time watching Marvel movies with his family or walking Suki, the Maltipoo.  While he doesn’t post often, you can follow him on Instagram at @weisberg262. I grew up in the suburbs of Detroit and played various team sports as a kid but was never all that good at any of them. I really enjoyed getting outside and running though so I stuck with cross country and track throughout high school. I loved competing, the feeling of pushing myself to get stronger and faster, plus the team camaraderie was unlike any other sport I had played.

I took a corporate job after graduating college which led me out west to Arizona. Moving out west reinvigorated my passion for running and being outside. I took up trail running, rock climbing, backpacking - pretty much anything to keep me outdoors whenever I wasn’t in the office. 

Eventually my company went up for sale and I found myself with a great severance package. I took the opportunity to do something I had always dreamed of and headed to South America on a solo adventure. While I was there I climbed 13 high peaks in the Andes and trekked through some of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen. 

After my trip, I didn’t feel an urgency to go running back to corporate America. Shocker. I had qualified for the Boston Marathon and decided to focus on that while contemplating what I wanted to do next. While training, some buddies of mine convinced me to sign up for a Spartan race. I had the time of my life.

I felt like a kid again, rolling through the mud, swinging across monkey bars, and barreling down steep hills through the Sonoran desert. I crossed the finish line, walked over to registration, and signed myself up to race the short course the next day. I placed top 10 overall, I couldn’t believe it! I was hooked.

Over the past year I’ve focused on developing myself to become a top contender in the world of obstacle course racing (OCR) and have put my corporate career on hold in the meantime. I absolutely love this sport that I’ve stumbled upon and how it pushes me to become an incredibly well-rounded athlete. OCR has really taken off in the past couple years and continues to draw some of the most talented and hard working athletes across the world. In order to keep up I have to constantly push myself to get stronger, faster, and more resilient. 

After placing first in the all-age division at the Spartan World Championship in 2018, I decided to begin racing in the elite category. Since racing as an elite, I’ve made the podium 4 times including my first overall win recently at the SoCal Spartan Sprint in Lebec.

I placed in the top 10 at the final US National Series race this year in Utah and at the North American Championship in West Virginia. I had a devastating DNF at Worlds in Tahoe due to hypothermia, but have my heart set on a top 10 finish at the 2020 World Championship.  

I moved to California just a few months ago (currently in Redondo Beach) and was lucky enough to stumble upon SBRC. This incredible group has welcomed me with open arms and it’s been so great having a community to train with. "

Treino Inteligente,"Saiba como ter uma vida melhor, através do exercício físico.Toda quinta-feira, a Personal Trainer Laís Monteiro e Rainier Morilla se juntam para falar sobre o Treino Inteligente. Discutimos sobre o fortalecimento muscular, o conhecimento do corpo, a superação dos desafios, a boa postura, a mudança de mentalidade, a melhora da autoestima e da qualidade de vida.Além disso, uma vez por mês recebemos a psicóloga Claudia Scattini Varandas para falar sobre como funciona a mente e alma humana. No Divã Inteligente falamos sobre os males do século como: Depressão, Ansiedade, Stress. Aprendemos como lidar com essas doenças e ter uma vida mais leve.Tudo isso com muito humor e descontração. Neste episódio de Treino Inteligente, Rainier Morilla e Laís Monteiro falam sobre os problemas cardiovasculares e como a prática dos exercícios físicos podem ajudar na prevenção deles.



AS DOENÇAS CARDIOVASCULARES



Para nos ajudar a responder diversas dúvidas sobre o assunto, convidamos Juliana Beust, formada em Educação Física pela PUC/RS, mestre em cardiologia e doutoranda também em cardiologia pela Universidade do Rio Grande do Sul.



Segundo a OMS (Organização Mundial da Saúde), dentre as doenças crônicas não transmissíveis, as cardiovasculares são ainda hoje, as que trazem maior risco de morte.



MAS O QUE SÃO ESSAS DOENÇAS?



As doenças cardiovasculares são um conjunto de problemas que acometem o coração e os vasos sanguíneos, trazendo graves complicações à saúde.



Como exemplo dessas doenças, temos, infarto agudo do miocárdio (ataque cardíaco), acidente vascular encefálico (AVC),  insuficiência cardíaca, entre outros problemas.



POSSO ADQUIRIR UM PROBLEMA CARDIOVASCULAR?



Existem diversos fatores que levam uma pessoa a contrair um problema cardiovascular, dentre eles, podemos citar dois principais: fatores externos e fatores genéticos.



Os fatores genéticos acontecem quando temos predisposição a contrair algum tipo de doença cardiovascular, nesse caso, não temos como controlar esse acontecimento, mas podemos amenizar buscando ajuda com os profissionais adequados.



Os fatos externos ou fatores modificáveis, acontecem devido a um ou mais hábitos que podem ser controlados para que a possibilidade disso acontecer reduza drasticamente. 



Entre esses hábitos temos tabagismo, má alimentação, consumo excessivo de álcool e principalmente o sedentarismo.



COMO POSSO REDUZIR AS CHANCES DE TER UM PROBLEMA CARDIOVASCULAR?



A primeira coisa a se fazer para evitar um possível problema cardiovascular, é evitar o sedentarismo e fazer pelo menos as atividades físicas mínimas recomendadas pela OMS.



Lembrando que atividade física não é a mesma coisa que exercício físico (ouça nossos podcasts Atividade Física x Exercício Físico, Volta a Calma e os de emagrecimento).



É recomendável também procurar ajuda profissional para um melhor acompanhamento, e quando falamos em ajuda profissional, não apenas um educador físico, mas um nutricionista, psicólogo entre outros. 



Esses profissionais vão te direcionar o melhor tipo de treino, de alimentação, e também te ajudar com o seu psicológico, fator extremamente importante para manutenção do bem estar. Você vive em busca de um corpo perfeito? Entenda a razão dessa busca e como isso pode influenciar sua saúde, beleza e bem-estar Conheça os bastidores e falhas do Treino Inteligente Ouça a continuação da série sobre emagrecimento. Quais os mitos e verdades sobre exercícios físicos e emagrecimento e saiba quais são os melhores exercícios físicos para emagrecimento. As razões que nos levam a comer são diversas. Seja o sentimento de culpa e autopunição; ou por compulsão alimentar quando fazemos alguma coisa sem a vontade e necessidade de fazer aquilo; por ansiedade e outros fatores psicológicos."

   Luke Edwards is an everyday guy, who makes adventure a part of his life. He's taken on hikes all over the world, as well as challenging expeditions involving multiple trails over consecutive days, in both NZ and Australia. Trek Coach recently joined Luke's team to take on the best of the 10 Great Walks of Queensland in 10 Days, an Expedition supported by the Queensland National Parks and The National Trust of Australia, Queensland. Here we discuss the highlights of the expedition, what motivated Luke to make this adventure a reality, and the lessons we learnt along the way.  Climbing the relatively unknown Mt Victoria in Papua New Guinea, with her husband, in challenging weather, running out of supplies and forging trails not taken before, was an adventure Robyn Mercer will never forget...Join Robyn as she shares with us how she came to love adventure, her training tips and why she takes on big goals. Heather is a serial trekker in Bhutan and has hiked there over many years. She has written about her adventures in the remote Himalayas and taking on some of the most challenging routes in Bhutan. Heather shoes us with here how she combined her love for hiking with a passion for helping others, and found a way to support a local charity through her trips to Bhutan and encouraging others to follow in her path.

Tri Chat with Lise Waltenbury,"Our mission is simple.  We want to encourage and engage female athletes across all distances, representing all athletic abilities.  We want to elevate everyday women to take their training to new heights. This is the start of the Journey:
 -Lise, Gabriela and Rebecca race together as a relay team at the Barrleman 70.3.
 -What happens when you get 3 strong swimmers on a relay team? They make plans for next season.
 Journey to Ironman, What is it?
 A group of 7 female athletes are following the same plan, Be Ironfit by the Fink's. 
 A few athletes are racing Muskoka 70.3 while the others are still trying to find their perfect race.  
 While Rebecca is registered for IM Mont Tremblant, it's a wait and see game for the rest of the crew.
 Until the next time, have a great active day.
 Bye!
   Welcome back Dr Tracey Teasdale ND
 Lise and Dr Tracey talk about the role of hormones play in athletes, in particular the distance athlete.  You can work your way through a short workout anytime of the month. Tracking your cycle will help you get in tune with your body and how your body responds.
 Garmin has a great tracking app. Fitbit and Apple watches also have them.  There are other apps that you can purchase of find for free.  P Tracker is the one that Dr Tracey uses.  You can also track the severity of your symptoms as well.
 A calendar and day planner will work as well if you are not into tech.
 Lise's goal race is IM Muskoka 70.3.  What are things that we can look at to optimize performance on race day.
 Your cycle is broken up in two phases. The first half and the second half.
 The first seven days we are lower in estrogen and progesterone.  Some say we are more like men because we don't have as much of these hormones that affect how we cool ourselves, how our fuel utilization is and how we recover.    That is usually when we feel the worst.  We have fewer hormones floating around, but it's usually the time when we are feeling crams, lethargic or nauseous.  Just knowing where you are in your cycle is important.  
 There are things a naturopath can help with, from a hormone perspective.  
 In training you can flip things around, but you can't do that on race day.
 Having an idea of where you are in your cycle and how your body will respond to the conditions is really beneficial to your performance on race day.
 The second half you get a peak in estrogen, then you drop off, you ovulate.  Then you another peak of estrogen progesterone that s the area when ere progesterone is a biggie.  That its when we get all of the PMS symptoms.  Not enough estrogen will do the same.  A naturopath can help balance those.
 In terms of endurance, Progesterone is important for distance athletes.  It delays the sweat response.  If you are working out in the heat. IM Muskoka 70.3, mid July in Muskoka Ontario, it will certainly be hot.  You don't sweat as much and the sweat response is delayed which makes it harder to cool so it means your hydration practices have to be spot on.
 Your plasma volume also drops so you don't have as much blood pumping around.  It also changes the electrolyte balance.  That information impacts the fueling and hydration status in plan for a race. 
 Lise could have used that information at the Barrelman 70.3.  Dr Tracey also ran a half marathon on Toronto Island on that unseasonably hot day.
 If women are on birth control or have an IUD, it's still beneficial to track, but the shifts won't be the same as someone naturally having their period.
 Women are more sensitive to daily changes in nutrition, fasting and not eating regularly. 
 We are also more sensitive to nutrient timing window after a workout.  Getting the fuel in right away helps setting you up for the next workout.
 Most female athletes that Dr Tracey has met are looking at weight loss.  While some caloric restriction is ok, but in the long run there can lead to the female triad.  We need to fuel for performance.
 Should Lise start trying with a base cycle.  This is the off season for most triathletes.  Weight loss is best done at this time.
 Lise attended ""The Art of Optimal Sports Performance"" workshop hosted by Dr Tracey Teasdale, ND. and realized that while she eats healthy and over the course of the week, gets all of her nutrients in, that day, she did not get enough protein.
 Generally, endurance athletes don't get enough protein or water.  Those are usually the first things to address to start performing better and weight loss.
 We can also track your nutrition as well to get a  snap shot to see if your fueling needs are met. 
 Getting enough sleep is also important.  Routine is important.  Going to bed and wak Lise interviews Kitti McKay.  She is a professional declutterer, organizer and productivity coach based in Halifax Nova Scotia. Kitti is passionate about promoting why decluttering is so important to your productivity and performance, and,while she is by no means a triathlete, she understands firsthand why an organized space is critical to your mindset There are 4 times a year wen we are triggered to loose wight. 
 1.  New Years
 2. Summer
 3.  Milestone birthday
 4.  September
 While it isn't easy, weight loss is possible if you tweet and stick to it. 
 Lise shares her struggles with weight gain and her weigh loss attempts in the last few years.
 Share your weight loss journey and success with us. Send a voice memo to Trichatlg@gmail.com with the title Weight loss Journey or Weigh Loss Success.
 Till next time, have a great active week.
  
   While it's been a full year since I have been training and recording consistency, I am now ready to get going again. 
Listen up to see my approach to stay in the sport over the long haul.  I want to qualify for Boston in my 70's or sooner."
The Triathlete Beat: A Beginner Triathlon Podcast,"The Triathlete Beat: A Beginner Triathlon Podcast helps beginners get into the sport of triathlon - join us for swim/bike/run tips, stories from the everyday athlete, and more! We truly believe that anyone can do a triathlon.Your host, Jeremy Tri, is an age trouper triathlete who fell in love with triathlon during his last semester of college. Since then, he’s competed in many races over the past 7 years and loves to encourage others to just get out there and TRI. On today’s podcast episode, we welcome Seth Rose of Transition Performance to the show! Seth is a Certified Mental Performance Consultant (CMPC) under the Association for Applied Sport Psychology (AASP) and has consulting experience with diverse athletes and performers in sports such as baseball, softball, golf, pole vaulting, rugby, soccer, basketball, martial arts, endurance athletes (swimming, cycling, running, triathlon), and many more at both the club and intercollegiate levels. Seth is super passionate about his craft and is an endurance athlete himself.

I’m very grateful that we connected online and were able to set up this podcast episode. Our chat is packed with some great stories and practical tips to help you train and prepare for your next triathlon, or any athletic event in general. Be sure to check out Seth and give him a follow at all his social links in the Show Notes! The Triathlete Beat podcast welcomes its FIRST GUEST EVER…Dr. Ryan Balmes! Ryan is a sports physical therapist who co-runs the ENDVR Health physical therapy clinic in Atlanta, Georgia. He is passionate about helping all athletes enjoy and play their sport. I was lucky to catch him while on a weekend trip to Atlanta and really glad we met up to make some content. Definitely check out the episode that we recorded on his podcast, The ENDVR Health Podcast as well! It’s been a while! Yes, that’s what I said on the last episode of The Triathlete Beat on August 7, 2018, but it’s now March 2019…and I’m fired up to put out more content this year! Today’s episode is a quick and informal update on 1.) What's kept me busy since the last time I podcasted and 2.) A slight update to the target audience of The Triathlete Beat podcast. As it's almost been half a year since I started The Triathlete Beat Podcast (crazy how time flies!), I thought I'd do a ""podcast checkpoint"" highlighting a few things: 1.) My progress with the podcast 2.) What kind of training have I been up to 3.) How my triathlon season has been so far &amp; any race plans through the end of 2018. If you want to get into running, and/or continue running for many years without injury, it is imperative to find the right running shoe for you. There are numerous benefits to selecting the best running shoe for your specific gait and running style.

Buying new running shoes can seem daunting and stressful at first, but it definitely doesn't need to be. This episode breaks down the process into a few basic tips on how to look for the right running shoe for you! In today's edition of ""Triathlon Quick Tips"", we go over a few reasons why buying a bike is NOT a necessity to do a triathlon. I give 4 scenarios in which you should not buy a bike for triathlon, and 3 scenarios in which you should buy a bike for triathlon."

Triathlon Taren Podcast,"The Triathlon Taren Podcast with Taren and NTK (No Triathlon Kim), features pro triathletes, heavy hitters in the triathlon world, age group triathletes from around the world, and coverage of races and triathlon events.  Every Sunday night on the Triathlon Taren Podcast you'll hear fun, engaging and informative tri-related interviews from the triathlon world led by Taren and NTK. The Professional Triathletes Organisation came out with some huge announcements this week, and we have PTO's CEO Sam Renouf on the podcast to explain what it all means. We talk about their first big event, The Collins Cup in May 2020, what being part of PTO means financially for pro triathletes, and why it matters to the sport. On this week's Triathlon Taren podcast, Taren talks all about zone training.  He breaks down how zone training works, talks about the science behind it (including specific studies) and how his own coach, Dr. Dan Plews, is using it with Taren as he attempts to qualify for Kona.

This week on the podcast, we talk to the newest coach on TeamTrainaic.com, professional triathlete and coach Scott Bayvel. Scott grew up in South Africa before moving to Australia for university, and found his way into triathlon after years of partying and smoking, after rehabbing a rugby injury.  With a new, healthy lifestyle under his belt, it turns out he was very talented in triathlon and won several major races as an amateur before recently going pro.  He's also a certified triathlon coach.  On this week's podcast, we talk to Dr. Dan Plews about the low carb, high fat training he's doing with Taren in his quest to qualify for Kona, how Plews prescribes training to the athletes he works with, and when athletes should do fat max, V02 max, lactate and ketone testing. The CEO of USA Triathlon, Rocky Harris, joins this week's podcast to talk about the changes he's made since taking the job two years ago.  He talks about the growth of the sport, and the steps USAT is taking to make the sport more accessible to aspiring triathletes."

Giving you better results, in less time, with fewer injuries. Our podcast is here to educate, inspire,and entertain. We’ll talk all things triathlon with expert coaches and special guests. Join the conversation, and let's improve together. Knowing how many watts you're producing on the bike gives you both insight and control during your training and racing. And with power meters and smart trainers becoming more and more affordable, training with power is more practical than ever. The ability to train with power is undoubtedly one of the most beneficial training investments you can make. In this episode, we discuss the intricacies of training with power meters and smart trainers and the tips and tricks to get the most benefit from using power in your bike training. Data and analytics have become an integral part of triathlon training. Yet, most triathletes don't recognize the true power of their data or realize the incredible results they make possible. In this episode, we cover analytics for triathletes in a way that is highly insightful for both novices and techies. We separate the meaningful from the clutter. We overview advanced analytics technologies such as data mining, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning and discuss how these technologies are changing the way we train and race triathlons. Nutrition is often referred to as triathlon's fourth discipline. There is undeniable value in properly fueling your body for training, racing, and a healthy lifestyle. Join us in this episode as sports nutritionist, Dr. Krista Austin, digs into performance nutrition and how to establish and maintain proper macro and micro nutrient intake relative to your resting metabolic rate and energy expenditure. She also offers clutch strategies for properly fueling and hydrating for optimal training, racing, and recovery. Since its origin in 2011, The Preseason Project has been a powerful triathlon training research environment and a catalyst for continuous improvement and innovation. The participating athletes themselves have made this possible.  Training data and direct feedback from more than 15,000 triathletes has driven significant measurable improvements over industry norms in training efficiency, race results, and overall athlete experience.  This has fundamentally changed how athletes train and how coaches coach.  Today we look back on the history of the Preseason Project and the milestone findings, results, and events that have defined its continuing influence on triathlon industry. Whether you're training for a local sprint or a full IRONMAN, training at the right intensity levels in your run sessions will pay off big time! But how do you know when to run 'hard', when to run 'easy', what exactly is 'hard' or 'easy', how long to hold different intensities, and when it's better to use heartrate or pace? In this episode, we'll drill down on these and other topics with run experts Jeff Raines and Elizabeth James. Assessments are about much more than just benchmarking your progress. Learn mental strategies to embrace the challenge of the week and practical tips for getting the most out of each session, We'll reveal many hidden benefits of your assessments, if performed correctly, and how they are used to optimize your training and increase your performance."

TriSpecific's | The Fat Black Podcast,"TriSpecifics Kristian Manietta shows you that you don't need talent or luck to succeed in Ironman Triathlon. You just need to DECIDE then follow a proven blueprint that's not following the same old dogma and outdated training models. Our driving focus is the minimal effective dose for the greatest possible outcome. The Fat Black podcast covers all topics Ironman Triathlon and how you can improve massively with focus on marginal gains. Basically we are highly performance orientated but we'll show you how to make it enjoyable at the same time. Today I have Joanna Zeiger on the podcast talking all about CBD. Joanna was a pro athlete from 1998 to 2010. She was 4th in the first ever triathlon in the Olympics in Sydney and then 5 weeks later was 5th at the Ironman World Champs. In 2008 Joanna one the 70.3 World champs…
 Joanna had a career-ending injury when a bottle handoff at the 2009 70.3 World Champs went horribly wrong. Joanna has been living with chronic pain ever since.
 This led to Joanna eventually trying CBD (with a lot of coercing from her husband, as school had focused on all the potentially damaging effects of cannabis, and being a professional athlete, drugs were are no go zone… Something we go into in the podcast).
 I’m super interested in the benefits of CBD… As we discuss it’s not for everyone and that’s ok. But there is a lot of information and miss information out there. So there are things you need to understand and this interview is a great starting place.

 Enjoy the show! Your best will never be enough unless it’s always enough – David Roche
  Today I have my run coach David Roche back on the podcast talking about their book (which is available now) which in my mind is required reading for all of us endurance athletes. The book might be using running and being a happy runner… you can just change running for Triathlete or cyclist or whatever. Charlotte and I got lucky and got an advanced copy… and Charlotte even got a quote on the back cover of the book! I’m so thankful we go an advance copy as it greatly helped me leading into my 110k race here in Whistler and then for my recent 100 miler. It wasn’t about Part two of the book on running principles but part one… running happy principles. A major one about self-acceptance and ultimately the results matter but they don’t matter.
 As always enjoy.
 IN TODAYS EPISODE, WE DISCUSS: Momento Mori, why talking about death matters!
 What’s really important to get results
 What self-acceptance means and how it helps
 The reason to decide now!
 Why hitting your life performance goals can leave you depressed and not fulfilled
 Cutting others and yourself some slack
 Depression
 The dangers of room temperature
 Why the parts that suck are super important parts of the journey
 How happiness is found in the atmosphere of growth
 Being enough doesn’t depend on a race result
 The striving for the result matters more than the result. the striving is the fun part.
 And  more

 Enjoy the show! So this is an episode I recorded after my 100 miler whilst down in California. We were staying with good friends Sean &amp; Tiana Rockwell in Grass Valley and we always talk about loads of topics on nutrition and hormones etc. I got a handy new zoom pro4n recorder so we sat down in her office talking about a topic that is rarely discussed.
 Tiana has been on the podcast before - episode 201, you can check that out - Tiana is an endurance athlete, dark chocolate lover, and a certified nutritional therapy practitioner who believes that real food can balance the body and produce personal record sports performance. 
 Now this one is for the ladies. But guys… This is a topic you probably want to understand a little more too.
 Today we are talking about menstruation and why it matters, we talk expectations and why and how to support the different phases of your cycle.
 As always enjoy.
 IN TODAYS EPISODE, WE DISCUSS:  The basics of the 28-day cycle What happens in each phase When the best days are for performance Expectations When it's a great time to race Negatives of trying to control your cycle High hormone and low hormone phases Strategies of racing around your cycle And  more  Listen &amp; Subscribe on iTunes | Stitcher Radio

www.the-resultslab.com In todays episode I discuss the ins and outs of being a gym beginner. As the the year and 2020 approaches, its a time where people join the gym in order to change their life. In this episode I try to cover some points that most beginners may not think about. As intimidation or lack of confidence is usually the beginners main issue, education around certain things may help with that. So in this episode I go through 8 points that will help the new gym goers of 2020, or any person who finds going to the gym a challenge.

Truelibido,My story of overcoming erectile dysfunction and a non-existent libido To learn more about how I overcame ED and boosted my libido naturally and permanently: https://truemalehealth.com/ This was my first encounter with erectile dysfunction. I tell you how it happened and what thoughts went through my head.
Trybsportowy.com Podcast o sporcie.,"Jest to Podcast o nietypowych sportach, o wywiadach z zawodnikami oraz o wszystkim dookoła naszego sportowego amatorskiego życia. Otworzenie swojej siłowni lub klubu sportowego to niełatwe zadanie. Koszty są ogromne, potrzeba ciągłej reklamy, zarówno offline i online, a przede wszystkim potrzeba zatrudnić odpowiednie osoby, którą spowodują, iż my jako klienci będziemy chcieli tam zostać i ćwiczyć w konkretnym miejscu z konkretnymi ludźmi. Tomek sam ćwiczył triathlon i chciał stworzyć miejsce, do którego sam chętnie by przychodził i w ten sposób powstało Trigym. Opowiada o tym jak myśl przerodziła się w realny, namacalny klub sportowy. Z jakimi wyzwaniami przyszło mu się zmierzyć i czy genialny produkt obroni się sam bez reklamy.

Miałem przyjemność być już na treningu prowadzonym przez Tomka i jestem pod wrażeniem jego podejścia. Do każdego podchodzi indywidualnie i bacznie obserwuje efekty.

W odcinku Tomek odpowiada na poniższe pytania odnośnie tworzenia klubu sportowego:
- Skąd myśl by stworzyć klub sportowy? .
- Jak wyglądał proces zamiany myśli w czyn?
- Dlaczego specjalizacja triathlon?
- Z jakim budżetem się to wiąże? I aspektami technicznymi?
- Czy specjalistyczny klub trzeba lepiej /inaczej promować?
- Jakimi sukcesami może się pochwalić klub?
- Czy otworzenie klubu zmieniło twój tryb treningu?
- Jak wyglądają zawody duathlonu wewnątrz budynku?
- Jakie papiery i gdzie trzeba złożyć by otworzyć swój klub
- Kogo potrzeba w klubie zatrudnić? I ile to osób?
- Ciekawostka o otwieraniu klubu, której ludzie nie znają lub nie przychodzi do głowy gdy się o tym myśli.
- Jaki inny sport byś polecił?
- Gdzie Was znaleźć online i na żywo?

Dodatkowo znajdziesz wyniki dwóch ankiet przeprowadzonych przeze mnie podczas występu. 10000zł - tyle wystarczy na cały sezon amatorskiego ścigania się motocyklem klasy 250 lub classic wliczając w to koszt motocykla. Dziki to zdobywca pucharu polski klasy sport250 oraz Youngtimer 500, więc potrafi oszacować koszty sezonu ale także nieziemsko szybko wjeżdżać w zakręty na motocyklu, który przeżył ponad 20 lat i miał ponad 70000km przebiegu. Jak sam stwierdził, czucie przodu motocykla pozwala mu wyprzedzać na wejściu do zakrętów, więc tam gdzie inni hamują i modlą się o trzymanie opon, Krzysiek dopiero przygotowuje się do hamowania i pokonania płynnie zakrętu. 


W odcinku Krzysiek odpowiada na te pytania odnośnie wyścigów motocyklowych:


- Jakie to uczucie być mistrzem polski w wyścigach motocyklowych?

- Kiedy zaczęła się Twoja historia z motocyklami?

- Jaka była maksymalna prędkość z jaką jechałeś? Oraz największa prędkość w zakręcie? Jakie uczucia tym prędkościom towarzyszą?

Outro: Ryan Little - Flew da Coupe Squash wydaje się być mini wersją Tenisa. Do tego zamiast świeżego powietrza, jesteśmy zamknięci w czterech ścianach ale czy na pewno jest to kopia innego sportu? Squash potrafi łączyć pokolenia. A do tego, pozwala dzieciom pokonać rodziców i to bez dawania forów. 


O tym wszystkim opowiada Maciej Sienkiewicz, który od 6 lat gra w squasha, a od 4 trenuje innych. Przebieg już setki kilometrów na korcie, uderzył w piłkę paręset tysięcy razy i do tego połamał kilka rakiet. Więc jak mało kto zna się na tym sporcie. 


W odcinku Maciek odpowiada na tę pytania odnośnie squasha: 

- Jak długo już grasz w squasha? 

- Od jakiego czasu trenujesz innych?

- Czym jest squash i skąd się wziął?

- Jakie są pokrótce zasady? I czym się różnią od tenisa? 

- Czy trzeba należeć do jakiegoś klubu by móc zagrać? Czy można trenować to samemu?

- Ile kosztuje squash? Co trzeba mieć ze sobą na treningu?

- Czy sprzęt w squashu ma znaczenie? Różnice pomiędzy piłkami lub rakietami.

- Od jakiego wieku można zacząć ćwiczyć squasha?

- Jak wygląda profesjonalny squash? Istnieją jakieś ligi/mistrzostwa? 

- Zalety squasha, które inne dyscypliny sportu nie maja?

- Ciekawostka o squashu, której ludzie nie znają?

Outro: Ryan Little - Flew da Coupe Wiele firm ma problem z pozyskaniem dobrych pracowników. Drugim problemem często są zwolnienia lekarskie tychże pracowników, co mocno wpływa na wydajność firmy.  Jaki związek z tym ma sport? Okazuje się, że ogromny. I o tym opowiada mój gość - Sebastian Muliński, współtwórca firmy (IAI) wartej 300 milionów złotych. Sam na co dzień trenuje w półamatorskiej drużynie siatkarskiej i zdaje sobie doskonale sprawę z mocy aktywności ruchowej w swoim życiu prywatnym, a także służbowym. 


Drugim gościem odcinka jest Łukasz Moroza, Marketing Manager w IAI. Jest to osoba odpowiedzialna za reklamowanie tej firmy i jej wartości na zewnątrz oraz wewnątrz. Dla Łukasza trasa z Świnoujścia na Hel na rowerze w 4 dni, to lekka wycieczka. W 22 odcinku TrybSportowy.com dzieli się on strategią wdrażania benefitów sportowych wewnątrz firmy. 

Ten odcinek ma na celu zachęcenie innych przedsiębiorców do inwestowania w sport w swojej firmie. Do budowania zespołu z zwycięzców w życiu prywatnym, służbowym oraz sportowym. Wierzę, że właśnie ta otwarta rozmowa z moimi gośćmi pokażę, iż aktywność ruchowa potrafi wpłynąć na wartość pracownika, przełożyć się na jego lepszą pracę i zbudowanie świetnego zespołu pozytywnych energicznie ludzi. 


W odcinku Sebastian i Łukasz odpowiadają na tę pytania odnośnie wartości aktywności ruchowej wśród pracowników: 

- Jak długo trenujesz triathlon?

- Dlaczego triathlon?

- Czy triathlon zmienił coś w Twoim życiu? Jakoś na Ciebie wpłynął?

- Jak zacząć trenować 3 sporty na raz? Z trenerem czy bez? 

- Czy sprzęt ma duże znaczenie?

- Ile to kosztuje? Pieniędzy i czasu. 

- Od jakiego wieku można zacząć ćwiczyć triathlon? 

- Jak wyglądają zawody? Na jakich dystansach się odbywają? Jakie to są trasy?

- Dla kogo jest triathlon? 

- Podaj 3 rady dla amatora odnośnie tego sportu. 

- Podaj ciekawostkę o triathlonie, której ludzie nie znają.

- Jaki inny sport byś polecił i dlaczego?

- Gdzie można Cię znaleźć w realu i online?

Episode 140 - Danny Cola - Owner of Danny Cola Fitness and host of The Danny Cola Podcast 
                  
“I live with a feeling of gratitude and love...life is all about perspective.” - Danny Cola 

In Episode 140, the Two Fit Crazies were joined by an amazing guest from Chicago by the name of Danny Cola. In true Joe Rogan style, Danny lights a joint and prepares “to take his thinking to the next level” with the Fit Crazies. Serving as the host of his own podcast, Danny is also the owner of Danny Cola Fitness. He believes that, in order to be successful in reaching any life goals, you must first focus on fitness, nutrition, and mindset. This former physical education teacher and coach reveals why he felt compelled to leave the world of teaching to bring even more value to the lives of others through both conventional and non-conventional practices. Danny discusses why the juxtaposition of Cannabis, CBD, Lion's Mane Mushrooms, and more with various exercise and mindset practices proves to be extremely effective for not only himself, but also for his clients. You will not want to miss hearing about Danny Cola’s latest project called “High Potential,” a new podcast that explores how to enhance your gratitude, love, and inspiration by doing the “inward work.”

Two Gomers Run For Their Lives,"The Two Gomers podcast chronicles the adventures of two non-athletes in their quest to become runners. Steven and Anthony, two friends that have known each other since middle school, learn all they can about running from surfing the web, believing suspect hearsay, and simply by trying something they’ve never done before: running exceedingly far distances that they’re convinced no human should ever run. Each week they discuss how the training from the previous week went, share tips they’ve either discovered through experience or that they’ve gleaned off the web, and cover many other topics that come up along the way.The Gomers kicked off their podcast on Sept 10, 2008 and have been going strong for 10 years and 8 very full seasons. They have trained for and run half marathons, full marathons, and triathlons in their endeavor to become healthier and find enjoyment in new activities. Even with breadth of running experience, still they are Gomers at heart. Part II of our annual New Year tradition: One Words!

Följ gärna Tyngre Rubriker på Instagram för att få del av relaterat material till podcasten. I veckans Tyngre Rubriker blir det endast två rubriker. Först får du höra om en stor svensk studie där man undersökt om kejsarsnitt ökar risken för övervikt hos pojkar när de är 18 år. Tidigare har man trott att så varit fallet men i den här studien såg man igen effekt.
 Efter det följer en diskussion kring en interventionsstudie där deltagarna fick äta 150 gram fruktos varje dag i åtta veckor. Trots den väldigt stora mängden fruktos så fann man inga betydande effekter på deltagarnas hälsa eller hälsomarkörer.

I veckans Tyngre Rubriker diskuteras fenomenet relativ energibrist och ätstörningar hos elitidrottare.

I veckans avsnitt av Tyngre Rubriker diskuteras först en debattartikel i SvD där det föreslås att föräldrar ska vara tvungna att se till att deras barn rör på sig minst en timme varje dag. Om de inte gör det så ska de utsättas för någon typ av straff.
 Efter det blir det en längre diskussion kring livsmedelsföretagens senaste undersökning kring svenska folkets matvanor och syn på frågor kring kost och hälsa. Vilka är deras största influencers, var får de sin huvudsakliga information ifrån och vilka källor ser de som mest trovärdiga?
 Till sist blir det en diskussion kring en långvarig prospektiv studie där man undersökt användandet av sociala medier och psykiskt välmående hos tonåringar.

Följ gärna Tyngre Rubriker på Instagram för att få del av relaterat material till podcasten. I veckans avsnitt av Tyngre Rubriker diskuteras flera heta ämnen just nu. Först får du höra om tidig specialisering inom idrotten och vad forskningen idag har visat kring detta kontroversiella ämne. Blir idrottare bättre om de börjar träna mycket på en idrott tidigt eller är det bättre att syssla med flera idrotter fram tills mitten av tonåren ungefär för att sedan försöka börja fokusera på endast en sport?
 Efter det diskuteras D-vitamin som kosttillskott. Från att ha visat på intressanta resultat i djurförsök och mer eller mindre konstans korrelera med negativa saker inom epidemiologin så har det på senare år dykt upp fler och fler väldigt stora interventionsstudier där man i princip inte sett några effekter alls. Hur ska denna data tolkas egentligen?
 Efter det så diskuteras problemet med att många nutritionsstudier inte blir rapporterade som de borde i större tidskrifter. Forskarna har ofta sagt att de ska undersöka en sak för att sedan rapportera någonting annat i själva studien.
 Till sist tar vi upp förra veckans avsnitt av Vetenskapens Värld där de visade ett reportage kring tarmbakterierna som verkade lova väldigt mycket kring framtiden.

Tyngre Träningssnack,"Följ med på djupet när fysioterapeuterna Jacob Gudiol och William Valkeaoja snackar träning. Wille har blivit pappa. Detta tar endast upp någon minut av avsnittet men det förtjänar ändå första packet när det gäller vad som är viktigt i dagens avsnitt.
 Efter den första minuten blir det sedan fokus på väldigt snabba distanslöpare som har slagit nya rekord de senaste åren. Främst blir det fokus på hur Nikes skor har påverkat hela den här utvecklingen men du får även lära dig vad det var som gör att Kipchoges tid på under två timmar på en marathonsträcka faktiskt inte räknas som ett rekord i marathon.
 Två dagar efter att det här avsnittet släpps så förväntas internationella friidrottsförbundet uttala sig kring hur de ska göra kring regleringen av löparskor och i det här avsnittet så får du höra det mesta som är värt att veta inför det beslutet.

 Efter det får du bland annat höra om hur man kan tänka i fall man vill försöka bibehålla så mycket av sina tidigare träningsresultat som möjligt i fall man över ganska lång tid kommer att behöva minska sin träningstid. Det blir också en diskussion kring CBD och problemet med att veta vad som finns i kosttillskott rent allmänt samt en hel del kring överföringen mellan olika typer konditionsträning.

Jonas Ludvigsson är tillbaka som gäst i Tyngre Träningssnack. Denna gången fokuserar vi på barnsjukdomar med utgångspunkt från Jonas nya bok  Barnläkarens guide - Farligt och ofarligt från nyfödd till tonåring.
 Jonas har varit med tidigare i podcasten, i avsnitt 62. Då diskuterade vi en av hans specialiteter nämligen celiaki, dvs glutenintolerans och om gluten i sig eventuellt kan påverka hälsan även hos personer som inte har celiaki.

Både hur man försöker mäta hur människor äter i verkliga livet och hur eventuella ätbeteenden korrelerar med människor hälsa.
 Till vår hjälp av vi Billy Langlet som för närvarande håller på med sin postdok inom ämnet. Du får bland annat höra om en sensor som fästs vid örat som kan känna av när människor äter och vågar som både mäter hur mycket mat du äter totalt sett och i vilken takt du äter maten.

  Martha Schoppe (pronounced Shop-pe) is no ordinary fire fighter.  She is part of a 20 person crew out of Durango, Colorado made up of 3 women and 17 men, part of the Department of Agriculture, US Forest Service.  They work 80-100 hours a week from April to October fighting wilderness fires.  Periodically they are called into help with structural fires but mostly they hike up and around mountains with 30-50 lbs of supplies (including shelter, food and equipment.)

Once she joined the 20 person Hot Shot Crew, she started running 4-5 miles 3 times a week to meet the fitness demands until she decided to join her sister on a Half Marathon in Denver 2011.  She has never looked back since.  That same year, she ran the Moab Trail Marathon and fell in love with trail running. 

In addition to participating in Power Lifting, Cross Fit and Ju-Jitsu Competitions, Martha completed the Chimera 100 Mile Run 2013, Susitna 100 Mile (self supported) Run 2014. 

While away fighting fires, Martha decided to support a friend battling breast cancer by cutting and shaving her hair as she reached certain dollar amounts in fundraising.  Please support Martha’s efforts here: https://www.youcaring.com/nurseinneed"

Uncharted Performance,"Sharing knowledge! Learn and apply key insights from the best & brightest in the fields of functional fitness, strength, and wellness. #upnation #reachtheuncharted The man that needs very little introduction. For episode 99 of Uncharted Performance we are honored to have a fantastic conversation about the future with the one and only Kelly Starrett of Mobility WOD. Kelly is a coach, physical therapist, author, speaker, mentor and creator, has revolutionized how athletes think about human movement and athletic performance. His clients have included Olympic gold-medalists, Tour de France cyclists, world and national record holding Olympic Lifting and Power athletes, Crossfit Games medalists, ballet dancers, military personnel, and competitive age-division athletes. In our conversation we get to know what stirs Kelly's interest at the moment and the foreseeable future, his creative process, how we can better refine information and deliver it to coaches and athletes, the process of communication in teaching and transfer of information, being able to function long-term and how to accomplish that, how we can improve in diagnosing and solving problems, the significance of fundamentals, the many teachers that influenced him, and the forgotten concepts of play and fun and how we can once again make physical activity a part of everyday life :) Politics, Religion, and Nutrition. Three of the most hotly debated topics known to man. Luckily, we take care of the nutrition debate in this week's episode of Uncharted Performance with Brian St. Pierre of Precision Nutrition (PN). Brian is renowned for his expertise in performance nutrition. He is both a Registered Dietitian with a Masters in Food Science and Human Nutrition along with a laundry list of credentials and publications under his belt. He has also consulted the San Antonio Spurs and Cleveland Browns on nutrition. Most importantly he is a a PN coach, helping individuals achieve their health and performance goals. We cover a variety of topics including personal experimentation, making mistakes, interpersonal variability, how we can, what we we eat, how much of it should we eat, meal prepping and planning, stress management as well as mindset. Brian also synthesizes the common denominators across ""diets"" and approaches to nutrition, breaks down the process of goal setting, highlights the importance of intentional daily practice, and distinguishes how we can become better coaches. Our conversation also debunks some of our favorite myths regarding a couple of our favorite macro nutrients, carbohydrates and fats. The nutrition conversation you were waiting for is finally here. Colorado’s premier Yoga and Pilates instructor, seven time bestselling author and recently named one of the Top Workout Brands by The Huffington Post, episode 97 of Uncharted Performance is excited to feature Sean Vigue of Sean Vigue Fitness. He was also recently featured in Yoga Digest, The Washington Post, Ultra Running magazine, Lifestyle for Men magazine, Curious.com, Pilates Style magazine, The Denver Post, Fit Bottomed Girls, The Broadway Blog, YoFitTV.com and numerous podcasts including this one. Sean Vigue Fitness is a StyleHaul partner and the Most Watched Yoga &amp; Pilates Guy on the the Planet! We discuss his background an actor and singer, what drew him to the practice of yoga, the impact that his practice has had on him, and the benefits it can provide us. Sean teaches us how develop an intimate relationship with our mind, body, and breath, the importance of being present, and the value of body awareness and how that translates to other movement practices and our relationships. With over 2,000 videos to date we also get a chance to understand his creative process from both a filming and a teaching perspective. Sean is continually watching and studying not only yoga but other modalities of self expression, creativity, and training but more than anything he has one special advantage, to find out who she is, tune in and enjoy! From growing up in the small rough town of Greenock in the west central Lowlands of Scotland, Greg McClure's journey to being the Fitness Manager at arguably the finest fitness facility in the world, Club La Santa in Las Palmas, Spain is unlike any other. We dive deep into Greg's hometown, the beauty of Scotland, his past training experience, travel, cross-cultural education and experience, his relentless work ethic, not being outworked by anyone, his addictive personality, his training regimen, bignastics, building people up and his lofty goals for the future, not only for himself but for CrossFit Club La Santa as well. We teased this week's guest last week on Episode 94 of Uncharted Performance with Mark England so it should be no surprise that we have the wonderful opportunity to talk to Mike Bledsoe of the Shrugged Collective and host of The Bledsoe Show. He is a true pioneer, influencer, and game changer, and one of the few individuals that have guided us on our path. We explore a number of incredible topics with Mike including a tutorial on creating connection, a full body connection with others, being present in our relationships, how curiosity can led us to what we are meant to do, his evolution as a person from what he was a number of years ago, to the man he is today (how he identifies himself), and who he might become in the future including the major impact point that set the course. We deconstruct the definition of normal, investigate his views on entrepreneurship, wealth and success, how Mike identities which skills to develop, how he has developed them, and what he is concentrating on at the moment (which might surprise you), the value of presence and what is possible through delivering bliss and joy to others. We had some unfinished business with Mark England of Procabulary. In our first episode we discussed in depth the power of language and how through the words we choose to use we can gain greater focus, clarity, and control one word at a time. This go around we explore a topic that has become very diluted in self development and growth circles, the subject of goal setting. Mark makes a clear distinction between dreams and goals. He also walks us through the careful process of creating your goals and the key variables associated with getting our thoughts out and crafting meaningful goals. We dig deep on not only the significance of writing our goals, but how they should be written, what we should be experiencing as we write them, and you guessed it, the words we should choose to use. Mark also guides us on which and how to go after our goals, setting and shifting priorities, and how to respond when our goals are not achieved in the manner in which we envisioned. Enjoy part two with our very good friend, Mark England!"

Undeniable Conversations,"At CrossFit Undeniable, our mission is to help our members thrive into their 90’s and beyond. These podcasts are recordings of Facebook Live episodes we hosted in our Facebook page. They cover everything from fitness to nutrition and beyond. In Episode 4 of the podcast, Zach and Jeremey discuss “the process” and why you shouldn’t be chasing quick fixes. The conversation was loosely based on this blog post and a Facebook series called “Killing the Fat Man” produced by CrossFit.



By “the process,” we’re referring to:



Move with intensity 5+ days per week.Eat clean, whole foods.



Good things will happen!



Some links from the show:



Commit to “The Process” blog postKilling the Fat Man, Season 2 on YouTube In Episode 3 of the Undeniable Conversations podcast, Zach and Jeremey talk about five things they wish they knew when they were starting out in CrossFit. This episode is applicable to both beginners and advanced athletes!



The five items are:



Establish a consistent routine.Embrace all aspects of health including nutrition and sleep.Set a plan for yourself and stick to it.Track your workouts.Remove ego and embrace scaling.



This episode, like all others in this podcast, were originally Facebook Live sessions filmed for the CrossFit Undeniable community. You can find out more about CrossFit Undeniable at our website – crossfitundeniable.com. In Episode 2 of Undeniable Conversations, we dive into goal setting tips and strategies including:



Remember your “Why?”Join a community and keep your goal visible.Keep it small.Track metrics appropriately.



These podcasts are originally recorded as Facebook Live session for the CrossFit Undeniable community. We strip out the audio and post them up as podcasts for everyone’s enjoyment.



Enjoy the show and drop us any feedback to info@crossfitundeniable.com! Welcome to our very first episode of Undeniable Conversations! These are short-form podcasts originally recorded as Facebook Live sessions for our athletes.



We’re looking to do these sessions weekly throughout 2020, but in this very first episode, we look back on moments we enjoyed in 2019 and what we’re looking forward to in 2020 both in business and our personal lives.



Enjoy!

Unleashed,"Release your dog's potential Even the best dog trainers have problems sometimes! – What you see on social media is not real life. Everyone that has multiple dogs has scuffles, has fights from time to time. Don’t take it personally. It doesn’t mean you failed as a dog trainer. It just means you have more work to do, which everyone does, say Nick and Joy Weis.



JEANETTE:
According to ASPCA, 3.3 million dogs enter shelters each year in the United
States, and there are millions of dogs waiting in shelters for a forever home.
For some, it’s a bit harder to find new families than others. There could be
many reasons for that, but a common reason is that they are too demanding. You
guys often end up with these dogs. Why?



NICK: We got into
dog powered sports because as a kid, I always wanted a malamute. We ended up
getting a malamute that had been returned because he was too high energy. The
family couldn’t handle him. So it was my opportunity for us to get a malamute.
We got him, and he was going to destroy our house. We had to find something to
keep him from destroying our house. We were not going to give up on him.



I
started in canicross for that reason. I just started running with him to burn
off energy so that he could get the exercise he needed to be a good dog. That
just let us see that there was really a need for high energy rescue dogs to
have a place that – they need a family where they can burn off that energy and
be the good dogs that they really are deep down inside.



JEANETTE:
But it can be quite hard to find that good dog sometimes. Do you have some tips
and tricks to share?



NICK: The biggest
tip, really, is exercise. In the U.S., we have a saying, “a tired dog is a good
dog,” and that’s really it. It’s about getting them the exercise that they need
to find that inner calmness that they all have.



JEANETTE:
Is this often underestimated when somebody gets, for example, a malamute or a
husky or a border collie, the level of activity these dogs need?



NICK: Absolutely. In
fact, almost all of our dogs have had homes before us where someone got them
and underestimated how much work they were going to get.



For
example, the dog that Joy ran with in the first World Championships that we
competed in was a dog that someone applied to a husky rescue. The rescue said,
“Your life is not right for a husky.” They said, “Too bad, I want a husky
anyway.” They went out to a different shelter, adopted one. Called this rescue
back and said, “Hey, you were right. We can’t handle a husky, but we adopted
one, so here. Please take him.”



People
really need to understand that huskies and malamutes and many other breeds out
there require a certain lifestyle. You have to make a commitment to that
lifestyle. If you’re not an active person, don’t get an active breed.



JEANETTE:
And you are quite active with your dogs. You’re doing canicross with them, and you
have done quite good. We are at the World Championships in Sweden right now,
and you have been running with one of your rescue dogs.



JOY: Yes. His name
is Oso and he is a husky mix. We adopted him several years ago from a shelter
in Oklahoma City, and he’d just had this third birthday.



When
we adopted him, no one wanted him. All of the people who had come to look at
him and see if he was right for their family took one look at him and said
“absolutely not,” and walked out the door. He would destroy wire crates. He had
had a couple surgeries with stitches and had ripped those out and tore up his
cone, had to have a muzzle. He was just sort of a mess, and people thought they
really couldn’t handle him.



We
came across him and we talked about it and talked about it, and we decided he’s
the perfect fit for our family. We have never had one problem with him because
from the moment we brought him home, we started running with him.



NICK:
We
find If you like to be active with your dog, canicross is the perfect sport for you! Everyone can do it – both proven runners and people who have never participated in competitions before. In this episode, Multiple World Champion Tessa Philippaerts from Belgium shares her tips on everything from how to get started to what to remember at a competition.



JEANETTE: Today’s guest was a Top 5 track and field athlete in Belgium.
Now canicross is her main discipline, and today the three-time world champion
will share some tips and tricks. Tessa Philippaerts from Belgium, welcome.



TESSA: Hi. Welcome.



JEANETTE: Thank you. First of all, can you tell us a bit what is
canicross?



TESSA: Canicross is basically running with your dog, but you’re connected to
your dog. The dog is not free-running, and the dog is wearing a special type of
harness in which he can pull freely, and he’s connected to the runner by this
elastic line. The runner is wearing a special type of belt. Usually they run
basically anywhere they want. They can go off-road, they can run a little bit
on the road.



JEANETTE: So it doesn’t need too much equipment. This is basically
something everyone can do.



TESSA: Yeah, everybody can do canicross. It’s really easy. You just need
basic equipment and a pair of running shoes, and then you’re good to go.



JEANETTE: How did you come into the sport?



TESSA: I was doing track and field from when I was 7 years old, I think, and
I always hated to do the long distance running training that I had to do by
myself. I really liked dogs, but after our last dog died, my father said, “No,
we do not really want to have a new dog anymore. It’s so much time.” So I kept
on nagging and nagging and nagging to get a new dog. My father saw I was
struggling with my training and he said, “Yeah, maybe if I can buy you a new
dog that can join you on your training runs, will you then go and do it more
often?” I was like, “Yeah, of course. Of course I would love to have a dog to
join me on my runs.”



We basically started to look online for which type of dog fit in with
our lifestyle, and we stumbled on the whippet, because they’re pretty calm in
the house and they’re active whenever they’re outside. They’re not the typical
canicross dog, but by then I didn’t know anything about canicross, so it was
okay.



After a while my father said he was looking on the internet, surfing,
and he found this sport where you can run with your dog. He was like, “That’s
something for you, canicross. Would you like to try it?” I said, “Yeah, we can
go one day and try it.” So one race somewhere in Belgium –There we started.
There was this small stand standing outside where they have all this equipment
hanging and you could try it out, or you can buy it. We just bought instantly
everything because I thought it was nice for running at home anyway.



Then we did the race, and I thought it was so much fun – even though my
dog didn’t get anything about what she had to do. But yeah, it was so much fun
to run with my dog. I remember I finished last place, but I didn’t care because
it was so much fun. After that day, I think we went to every possible race.
Then we got really stuck with canicross, and we got better and better during
the years, so that was really cool.



JEANETTE: You also got more dogs.



TESSA: Yeah, because I think after two years of doing canicross, my father
said “This is actually so much fun. Can I borrow your dog?” Of course, “No.”




 Then he was like, “Okay, then maybe we can buy another dog.” So we
bought a second whippet. Then he started to race as well with her.





From then on, we started to get more dogs after my whippet got injured
when she was 4 years old. I was so sad. I remember I was just so sad, because
she was actually really good for a whippet running in canic Do you know what to do if your dog gets a paw cut, suffers from diarrhea and vomiting, or eats a plate of chocolate? Veterinarian Trude Mostue shares her best first aid tips.

Untapped Personal Training Podcast,"Untapped Personal Training presents on topics of health, wellness, fitness, and performance. The Untapped Personal Training podcast is all about empowering and informing athletes and coaches alike, because we all get better when we all get better. We look forward to sharing our knowledge and being part of your journey. Are you lifting weights for your sport or martial art? Probably isn't helping, is it? That's probably because you're doing too much for it to be effective and following a routine that preaches balance and all that malarkey. Sport specific strength training is only as good as the athlete's ability to sustain it; full body and split routines really aren't going to be sustainable for the average athlete not using PEDs. Some post-seminar thoughts about the ""Nutrition for Athletes"" seminar last night at WEphysio Performance and Wellness. The podcast still has a takeaway for you even if you didn't attend, so still give it a listen. Getting injured is never a good thing. About the only thing worse, is re-injuring your original injury. Maybe supplements and medications are useless for healing injuries, but food sure isn't. With a couple of minor tweaks to your diet, you can mend a lot faster than the baseline predictions would suggest. Want to heal injuries fast? Don't we all. How you divide your calendar will decide how well you perform in your sport. With a couple of simple examinations of what phase or season you are in, there are gains to be had."
Upfront About Breast Cancer,"From dealing with treatment side effects to minimising your medical bills, Upfront About Breast Cancer combines expert advice with stories of lived experience on topics relevant to Australians affected by breast cancer.

Victory With Vatche,"Welcome To The Victory With Vatche Podcast! This podcast was started because I want to make sure that every single person out there never feels alone on their weight loss journey. Losing weight is difficult. You don't have to go in alone! In this podcast, there will be many topics and questions covered that will help guide you.Let Vatche lead you to Victory with his experiences and knowledge on losing weight in a sustainable approach. Overeating is something we all struggle with. It doesn't make you a bad person. It just makes you a human being.



Overeating is a common thing but it can be prevented. 



I used to struggle with overeating and binge eating and I thought I would never be able to have a healthy relationship with food.



After using different tricks and making sure I don't beat myself up after overeating, it really helped me overcome my overeating issues and now I am proud to say that I have a healthy relationship with food.



If you struggle with overeating, this episode is for you.



I go over different tips and tricks you can use to help you prevent overeating, as well as guiding you after overeating.



I hope you enjoy this episode on overeating When it comes to weight loss, you are going to need a plan of action in order to get the best results!

If you do not have a plan and just go in blindly, you are going to be confused, nervous, and ill-prepared.

If you follow the steps in this episode, you will find that weight loss is not that daunting of a task.

When we are trying to lose weight, we are going to be hungry and we are going to want to give up at times. But you know that your future self will thank you if you stick with it.

But that's only if you stick with it!

In this episode, I go over some crucial things on my weight loss checklist that you should follow, especially if you are a beginner or are struggling to see results during your weight loss journey.

I hope you enjoy this episode and I know you will find value in it.

Enjoy! In this episode, I talk about 6 common things that people do throughout the week that can be adding a lot of calories to their overall diet and thus derailing their weight loss progress.



If you are struggling with results and are frustrated, you will definitely enjoy this episode of the Victory with Vatche podcast.



I struggled with these things and I want you to know that if you are struggling with your weight loss, you are not alone. I was in your shoes! It takes a lot of patience and consistency... but once you find your groove, results will be coming in!

Enjoy. When we are trying to lose weight, it is tough because we are going to get hungry. If you are struggling with hunger during your weight loss journey, just know that you are not alone.



These 6 things I talk about in the episode really helped me out when I was first losing weight and I know they can help you out as well.



If you are struggling during your weight loss journey, just know that you are not a failure. You are a human being and you are stepping out of your comfort zone in order to achieve a better life and health. Go you! I want you to succeed soooo badly! That's why I am here!


I hope you enjoy this episode. You got this!! Whenever weight loss is brought up, some people have different opinions about how you should go about losing weight. Some might suggest going low-carb or some people might suggest cutting out ALL 'fun' foods like pizza and donuts (food you really enjoy).



Look, a lot of information out there is confusing and it can make weight loss a really daunting task. I get that!



You don't have to be so extreme with your diet. You just need to track your calories.



In order to lose weight, you need to adhere to a calorie deficit consistently!



In this episode, I talk about why calories are the most important thing when it comes to weight loss and how you should be tracking your calories in order to make weight loss less confusing.



If you want to lose weight, you don't have to only eat organic, clean, natural, non-gmo foods.



Yes, quality is important when it comes to your health. I am an advocate for eating fruits, veggies, legumes, etc.



But quantity (calories) is the most important when your goal is weight loss.



Just so you know, I'm sure I say the word 'calories' 100 times throughout this episode.



Thanks for watching, and as always, I appreciate the support!! When it comes down to it  - we really have 2 options when it comes to our bodies and health



Do we live a life filled with proper nutrition and exercise? Or, do we choose to live a life with no exercise and no regard for nutrition?



Hitting the gym, tracking food intake, and eating more nutritious foods is hard. There's no doubt about it.



But being overweight, unhappy with your body, and being more at risk for certain diseases is ALSO hard!



You need to choose your hard. What are you going to choose? Because I know for a fact you will be better off by choosing the diet and nutrition route.



As a teenager who would only fit into 3XL shirts and size 40 waist pants, let me tell you something: Being obese and not confident in my own skin was SO HARD.



Joining a gym for the first time, eating 'right' for the first time, and building healthier habits is also hard.



What's it going to be? You have to choose your hard."

Vigor Life Podcast,"Luka Hocevar is the owner of the nationally renowned Vigor Ground Fitness and Performance gym in Seattle and founding father of Vigor Move & Live in Slovenia, featured in Men's Health, Stack Magazine, Onnit Magazine, Entrepreneur Magazine, and on CBS. As a leading fitness and personal development coach this Vigor Life podcast is an extension of what Luka coaches every day and will provide tips, stories, motivation and inspiration to help you forge daily habits for a better body—through fitness, nutrition and mindset—build better relationships, create purpose in your career/business, increase productivity, be happier, and succeed (success comes from succession as in the ""next step"" - constant growth and expansion in your life).  The Vigor Life podcast will help you piece together the puzzle pieces to your own extraordinary life. Years ago I crashed and burned. The cause of my burnout was a decade of working like crazy and not sleeping enough... to the tune of 3-4 hours a night. This led me to go to the doctor and get tests done. The results of those tests led me to overhaul my health and prioritize sleep. I’ve done a podcast on sleep before, but when I heard Nick Lambe's talk at an event we were both speaking at, I knew I needed to bring him on the show. 















Nick spends the most of his time coaching clients on how to fix their sleep patterns. Sleep—more specifically, getting enough sleep—is an important topic that, for many of you, may be the single most important thing you can do to help your health, wellness, performance, and happiness in 2020.







In this episode Nick and I talk about the real world ways you can help improve sleep, the real dangers of not sleeping enough, as well as the practical tactics and strategies that Nick uses to get results for his clients. We also talk about how coaches can (and should) educate themselves on the importance of sleep. In particular, how to help improve the sleep patterns of their clients. 







This episode will give you strategies that will not only benefit your life, but also help you get better results, and become more valuable to your clients.







Let's go.















IN THIS EPISODE YOU’LL LEARN:







* How Nick, a strength and conditioning coach, became a sleep coach.* How improving your sleep will improve every area of your life and make you a better and nicer person.* How to know if you're putting enough emphasis on sleep.* Why most chronic sleep issues are behavioural, but can start with a life event such as an injury, new career or stress. We discuss how to overcome the issue so that it doesn't become a pattern.* How thoughts can affect your sleep and create a vicious cycle of insomnia.* Why people are affected by sleep and the practical lessons you can apply to your life to change bad sleep patterns into good ones. We give some powerful real world examples which you will be able to apply to your life. * Why sleep MUST be coached to clients and not just given to them as a “sleep hygiene” list.* Why what you associate your bedroom with is critical for quality sleep. Learn the “2S” acronym that is the only thing you should be using it for.* Blue screens aren’t as bad as we think. Nick shares what you should really focus on.* The 3 big reasons you should get rid of your sleeping pills now!* Powerful and practical insights that can improve your sleep fast.







And much more.

Vigor Life Podcast (iTunes): https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/vigor-life-podcast/id1180256583?mt=2 I've known Dr. John Rusin for over 6 years now – both as a friend and  colleague. In that time I've had the pleasure of hosting John at four events, including the PPSC certification – which brought together 110 coaches from all over the world. In 2020 John's Pain Free Performance Training Certification course will be certifying close to 5,000 coaches all over the world because it straight up works. 















I love talking with John on the podcast because it's a chance for us to catch up and discuss how our thinking and experience around training has evolved. In particular, what we do with clients to get the absolute best results.







In this episode I talk to John about sequencing, quality of reps, the structure of a great training session, rep ranges, pump work, and everything in between. Expect some great insights that will help you improve the training and coaching of your clients as well as your own training.







Let's go.















IN THIS EPISODE YOU’LL LEARN:







* How to use John’s P4 model (Prepare, Prime, Perform, Pump) in your own training to maximize gains * The biggest mistake people make when taking a one dogmatic approach to their training* The definition of the “meathead de-load” and why you’re probably doing it (and why you shouldn’t!)* What a  true max effort method lift is and how you can rotate exercises and reps for maximal results and pain-free performance* Why you should only “sprinkle in” true max effort reps and have them be absolutely pristine* Why the volume in a program should come from pain-free volume in the supplement and assistance work in training * Why the KEY to working on your reps is based on your daily performance NOT on structured percentages (we reveal some methods we use)* Why it’s not the smartest training 4 big lifts in the 1-5 rep range in the same session and what ranges to use* How to use energy system training to enhance your recovery and bring your lifts up (yes, cardio can bring your lifts up!)* Novelty and why it’s so important for buy in – as well as getting better results* How to make a BIG difference with “slight variations” in your daily training programs and how it addresses the dynamic stability* How to de-construct the program for someone that has been in pain and switch it up so they get stronger and build muscle pain-free* How to apply tools, methods, and exercises you like into your programming and STILL stick to the principles that will help you succeed with your training







And much, much more.

Luka Hocevar YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ29YcBh-g6onRujX3wD_XA? When I first met James Foster a little over 6 years ago it was an instant connection. At the time, we were both helping each other grow. Myself helping him grow his BJJ dojo, and him teaching me BJJ. But the lessons did not end there.















James, a 20 year BJJ veteran, has been highly respected in the BJJ community for a long time. In the the last 6 years however, he has made some serious achievements both personally and professionally. His two most notable achievements are being named the 3x ultra-heavyweight BBJ World Champion, while also growing his dojo to the biggest in Washington State with an ever growing program for kids.







In this episode we talk about everything from mindset, to practice, and the “secret” to becoming the best in the world. We also dive into how to apply these lessons to your life – whether you're coming from the world of business or not. We also talk about the art and science of coaching and the importance of it in every training session and moment.







Let's go.















IN THIS EPISODE YOU’LL LEARN:







* The principles and characteristics of a champion that breed success in sport, coaching, business and life* Why you need to ""be real"" with yourself, and respect / know that being perfect isn't the key to success* Why leading from the front in your business is a must, despite the cliché. We breakdown what it actually means to lead from the front* The reason why competing will give you a reality check in how good you are* What “IASM” means and why it’s a key to charging more and valuing yourself more in business and life* The foundational skillsets and mindsets of an excellent coach* Why it’s important to take advice from people that have been there, done that, and are STILL doing it – and how this will help you achieve longevity* Why knowledge + experience + results + longevity = a great coach  * Why you CAN learn from everyone and the importance of keeping an ""empty cup"", especially if you're a young and/or new coach* How to earn your respect in the industry, grow your business and do what most aren’t!* Why you must never lose the pulse of your culture in your business, or anything else in life if you want to improve* Why you should always work on the things you’re not good at







And a lot more.

I’ve spent the last two decades studying with the best of the best to learn how to get the best results (through training) for myself and my clients. A standout lesson in my years of training and experimentation came from Mike Robertson and Bill Hartman. These two very smart men gave me a structure that simplified what to include in each session, along with a lens to view my programs through to ensure that I'm getting the best results for my clients, and myself. Their method has since became the framework for how we write most of our training programs here at Vigor Ground for both our personal and group training clients. 















In this episode I break down each “R” of the R7 system and the principles and science behind it. I also go into what it looks like in the real world of exercises and programs.







This is a must listen if you train clients.







Let's go.















IN THIS EPISODE YOU’LL LEARN:







* Why most people are living on the “fight or flight” part of the spectrum of their nervous system, when they should instead address the first two “R’s” in their program to ensure that they're getting the best results out of their training* Why people can foam roll and warm up too much and then not get the results from training* What “Release” is and how it can be a huge factor in feeling better and performing better in your training* The R7 protocol and how it creates a flow of the training session from low intensity to high intensity to recovery* How to decrease stiffness and pain and improve mobility. I give you the specific strategy* How to improve biomechanics position and autonomic balance* Why if you have to foam roll everything you’re doing it WRONG, and why this is a tell tale sign that you need to check your program!* How to restore position, balance inhalation vs exhalation, improve mobility with two exercises in the “Reset” stage* The most powerful reset you have in your arsenal is high quality exercise technique and program design* The three-step process to warm up in your “Readiness” stage* The warm up that sets the stage for your entire workout, and how to make it a priority in your training sessions* Why everyone should do reactive/power work, whether in private, semi-private, or groups – from pro athletes to 70-year olds * Programming from the neural to the metabolic spectrum and how to use it in your programs







And much, much, more.

Thanks so much for joining me this week. Have some feedback that you’d like to share? Leave me a review on a href=""https://itunes.apple. Recently I was down in San Diego for an event my friend Craig Ballantyne was putting one. While there Jay Ferruggia and I decided to take the opportunity to visit the famous Glute Lab to train with our friend Bret Contreras. AKA “The Glute Guy.” Apart from a great training session, we got to talking about training, which led to this podcast episode.















In it you'll get some powerful insights on program design, joint-friendly training, building muscle (at any age) and how to stay in the game forever – along with some industry secrets, and much much more.







The three of us have a combined 60 years of coaching experience under our belts, and have been training personally for 25 years or more years (each). This hour of power is a look into what works in the real world, and why we were wrong about some things that we only learned through decades of experience coaching clients.







This is a ""must listen"" episode if you're a coach.







Let's go.















IN THIS EPISODE YOU’LL LEARN:







* The big mistakes most people make when programming for building muscle and why you will fail if you do this* Why you’re doing too much and not doing it well enough* Why talking smack about machines was mistake and why we love machines and how to use them* Why joint-friendly training is the solution for long-term strength, muscle, performance, and feeling great* The exact model Bret uses to get people results month in and month out, for the long haul (steal it!)* Jay’s secret on sequencing exercises and why NOT to start the day with the big lifts - this is a game changer when you implement it* How I cycle bilateral and unilateral exercises as main exercises, rotate joint-friendly lifts, and change the reps of my PR’s to constantly improve * What should you focus on the most: Intensity, Volume, Frequency?* The ideal training splits for most people and the break down of what has been the “bread n' butter” in getting results for our clients us for decades* The key to longevity in the fitness game as coach. We share our wisdom from decades of work and many mistakes







And much more.

Luka Hocevar Instagram: a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www. At Vigor Ground we teach that there are four components to success in a body transformation: training, nutrition, mindset, and recovery – with mindset being the integral center. 







Despite the importance of mindset, many people ignore it – which can lead to bottlenecks and failed results. In this podcast I go over 14 lessons and strategies to improve your mindset so you can build success, no matter which area of life you want to improve.







This episode is a must listen if you have ever struggled to reach a goal in the past. It's also a must of you coach people in any capacity.







Let's go.















IN THIS EPISODE YOU’LL LEARN:







* Why thinking bigger and bolder is a MUST—not selfish or “unrealistic”* My realization of having to do more of less, and why destroying yourself with work will prevent you from changing your life and your business* Why I believe that every day that you hesitate to share your gift with the world is selfish. And why I started creating more once I realized this truth* Omnipresence – why being everywhere all the time can help you, and how to do it* The 5 questions that will have you set your ego aside and help you grow from week-to-week * Why you may think you know better, but you don't. And how to change this mindset if you have it* How to be more resilient and anti-fragile—which is foundational in the world of entrepreneurship (and life in general)* The way I deal with struggle and turn it around to strengthen my mindset and resolve* 3 things you must do on a daily basis in the “mindset gym” to become unstoppable* And much more…

Warrior Motivation Show,"""it's okay, I think it's sexy when a man has a bit of pudge on them..."" A bit of pudge! She was being way too kind ...I was fat! She was just being nice, that amazing wife of mine. She deserved better. She deserved to have a husband that wasn't fat, ugly and disgusting. She deserved the hot bod I had when she fell in love with me. She deserved someone that wasn't slow, and low energy. Someone that didn't feel so self-conscious and unattractive.  It has been years since I let her see me with my shirt off. It was months since I've stepped on a scale. I wasn't comfortable. I didn't feel attractive in her eyes, no matter what she said. How did it come to this. I used to be so hot. So sexy. So ripped living life as a Personal Trainer and Bodybuilder. I had found my dream girl. The love of my life. The most beautiful woman I've ever met loved me as much as I did her. She said ""Yes"" to spending our life together, betroved to one another. I got comfortable. I got complacent. I let myself go. I put on weight. Ate whatever I wanted. Stopped working out diligently. I stopped and started so many diets, plans, and routines, but no matter what I did, I just couldn't stick with it. My motivation was gone. I lost my ""mojo"" and had no idea how to get it back.  It's ironic because when I was a rockstar personal trainer at the club, it was my clients that complained about that all the time...""How do I get motivated, Coach?"" I didn't really have an answer for them as I never struggled for motivation. It wasn't until I began struggling with that myself that it started to make sense. ""How..."" I asked myself as I looked at my bulging ""ice-cream"" belly and man-boobs in the mirror......""How did I fall so far?"" But then I discovered a secret Motivation MethodArmed with that Method, I began my GMHB journey, Getting My Hotness Back. :) This podcast is documenting that journey going from fat husband to sexy one using that Method and taking you on the journey. Come along this journey and discover for yourself what this secret Motivation Method is all about. “Oh my goodness! That’s what I look like!? I’m fat and gross!” 
  
  This is what went through my head when I saw pictures of me from a recent family get together.   I was always so self conscious of my body. Of my weight. But for some reason, it never really hit me until that day. 
 “How had it gotten this bad? I used to be so hot. So sexy. So in shape. Ripped body, chiseled arms. 8-pack abs and everything. 
 How did I fall so far?” 
 I had lost my mojo. 
 Well, let me give you a condensed version and you’ll hear more of the story through listening to the podcast… 
 Basically your host’s journey here goes like this: 
  
 Fat -to-
  broken heart -to-
  fit -to- 
 Ripped, personal trainer, model and bodybuilder 
 -to- 
 Finding my dream girl and getting married… 
 Got comfortable and letting myself go… 
 Now back to Fat again.  :( 
 We call that cycling. 
 And it seems to be the standard for those that don’t know this “motivation secret”. 
 I discovered this secret and now using it on my journey back to hotness and sexiness, so that I can feel more attractive around my wife... 
  
 And look good naked. :) 
  
 ✔️If you struggled with “staying motivated” on your health-conscious journey, then this is the show for you. 
  
 ✔️If you’ve tried programs and had trouble sticking to them, then you’re going to love this motivation secret. 
  
 ✔️If you’re looking for the edge in your workouts and meal plans, you found it. 
  
 ✔️If you want the missing piece to what all those other trainers and guru’s unknowingly leave out, then you’ve found the right place.

We Only LOOK Thin,"Catherine and Donald Wygal are a married couple who, after a life-long struggle, have each lost over 100 pounds.  Join them as they work on keeping the weight off and pass along what they've learned along the way. Sure, moving around sounds like a lot of work.  We’d all rather sit on the couch and do nothing, but it turns out that isn’t a good idea when it comes to health and fitness.  This week, Catherine and Donald throw excerpts from a bunch of studies at you that indicate that a sedentary existence is bad for your health in more ways than just your weight.  They also give you loads of tips on how to get more movement into your life without having to become of full-time athlete and without even having to set foot in a gym.   The Product of the Week (POW!) is the Fitbit fitness tracker.  Plus, Catherine calls herself a fitto introverto, Donald wears knee socks, and the couple ask the age-old question, what exactly did the Happy Days gang want Potsie to sit on?

						Share If you were a movie goer in the 80s, you know the rules for Gremlins.  Don’t expose them to bright light, don’t get them wet, and don’t ever, ever feed them after midnight.  What if people came with convenient warning labels with do’s and don’ts for their weight-loss and fitness adventures?  This week, Catherine and Donald continue their lists of the rules that they’ve leaned work for them to lose and maintain 100 plus pounds of weight loss.   The Tip of the Week (TOW!) is to dress for the job you want.  The Product of the Week (POW!) is the Instant Pot.  Plus, Catherine conveniently forgets a pretzel roll, Donald leaves his coffee in the other room, and If you’ve already planned for it, you don’t have to plan for it.  It’s one of those rare instances when the sequel is even better than the original.

						Share Just like Gremlins begin as a cute and cuddly Mogwai, so do fitness journeys begin with good intentions.  Feed us after midnight however, and it’s like a bunch of tiny monsters terrorizing a small town at Christmas.   This week, Catherine and Donald discuss their rules that keep things “cute and cuddly” while they lose and maintain their weight.  The Tip of the Week (TOW!) is to get rid of something that is making you feel bad about yourself.  The Product of the Week (POW!) is Brittany Runs a Marathon.  Plus, Catherine pays for pancakes she doesn’t eat, Donald would make a terrible gift for your kids, and the couple like to rock the party.

						Share It’s the We Only Look Thin two year anniversary!  As we embark on another year and a new decade, it is important to reflect on what got us to where we are right now.  In your 20s, losing weight feels largely like a vanity project.  In your 40s and beyond, it’s about improving health and quality of life.  This week we look at past successes and failures.  No matter where you are in your fitness journey; just getting started, coming back after an absence, or trying to maintain, Catherine and Donald  put a spotlight on the core habits that will point you in the right direction.  Plus, Catherine does an excellent Adele impression, the couple emerge from a fruitcake filled haze, and Catherine is pretty in the face.   We’re asking you as you’re starting 2020 to set some realistic goals, put some realistic habits in place, but push yourself a little bit harder.  You really do matter.

						Share This week, two people who wear glasses talk about having 20/20 vision. Or rather, a vision for the year 2020!  Just like you should get an annual eye exam, you should also examine your health, weight loss,  and fitness goals. How did your fitness choices serve you in 2019 and how would you like to change them for the coming year? We can have a dream in front of us, but unless we set specific actions to get to that goal, it’s just going to be a mirage.  Catherine and Donald talk about ways that you can have a clear vision of what your goal is and a plan to actually achieve it.  The Tip Of the Week (TOW!) is not to get caught in no man’s land.  Plus, Donald and Catherine are a Limited Lunch Company, Donald is Captain Toothbrush, and you can’t grow a plant from hot mud alone.

Weakly Weights,"Alex and Will sit down weekly and talk about all things powerlifting. General chit-chat, case studies and interviews with lifters and coaches.Sign up for our Newsletter for free stuff! https://mailchi.mp/a5b20bad6a42/weakly-weights-newsletter Mike joins the boys to talk about his practice as one of the most successful powerlifting coaches in the world today. We cover the concept of RPE, what problems it helps us address, and how perceptions can and do differ from a strict rating of reps in reserve. We then talk about emerging strategies, and how as coaches we can assess whether and how well training is working.  The boys talk about the process (TM) of reintroducing lifters to training post-comp. We also cover a brand new review paper about the minimum effective training dose required to increase strength.  Jamie joins the boys to talk about predictors of injury risk in lifting. We talk about the assumption that assymetrical postures are injurious or necessarily limiting, before discussing what other factors might better describe injury risk. We dive into the idea of the acute:chronic workload ratio, explore its applications and limitations, and then talk about how biomedical, psychological and social factors can impact our experiences in the gym and life more broadly, and how coaches can communicate better in light of the information we discussed in this episode. We also discuss Maroon 5 and explore the quality of various fast food chains.  Dr Daniel Hackett of the University of Sydney joins the boys to talk about his research. We focus on two papers that are soon to be published discussing the trainability of men and women. We talk about the limitations of research and our knowledge, and why differences between practice/anecdote and research might exist, and the ways in which trainers and coaches can be more scientific in their approach.  Will and Alex discuss a program that the former has written to peak a client for both deadlift stances at once. They discuss what changes about the programming strategies used to facilitate this goal, and some considerations for programming around unusual circumstances. More importantly, they discuss the appropriate amount and technique for consuming Milo, periworkout carbohydrates, and the recent Record Breakers powerlifting competition. Luke joins the boys to talk about fatigue. We talk about what fatigue is from a physiological perspective, delineating between central and peripheral components, and then discussing how they are interrelated. We also chat about which types of training induce more or less fatigue, why and how it can be important to monitor fatigue, and some practical considerations for your training structure. "
Weight Down Life Up,"This is the Trailer for my Weight Down Life Up Podcast. In upcoming episodes I will be documenting my journey of losing a significant amount of weight and picking my life back up along the way. On this episode I preview what is to come on the Weight Down Life Up Podcast. Each episode will follow me along this crazy journey of losing a significant amount of weight, and the struggles physically and mentally that I deal with. I will be interviewing people who have helped me and continue to help me along my journey. I will also be sharing tips, personal stories, and having a lot of fun along the way of putting the weight down and picking life back up."
Weight Loss,"Weight loss can have causes that aren't due to underlying disease. Examples include dieting, exercise, malnutrition or lack of access to food. Looking to lose weight quickly and in a sustainable way? Here's how to lose fat and lose weight to improve your overall quality of life for good!"
Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,"Are you a busy physician who wants to lose weight permanently so you can have the life you want? This podcast is the resource you’ve been looking for. I’ll guide you on the journey to overcome stress eating, exhaustion, and overwhelm - and move into freedom around food. Each week, this podcast brings you specific tools and resources to meet the challenges busy doctors face. Your time is valuable - and so is your wellbeing. We’ll help you find the time to care for yourself as well as you care for your patients.-Learn new ways of thinking that make good eating decisions automatic and result in permanent, effortless weight loss.-Find out how to gain the time and energy to take care of yourself the way you tell your patients to!-We’ll show you how to stop overeating and using food to deal with stress and exhaustion.-You’ll learn to improve your relationships and to better deal with the difficult people in your life so you don’t need food to cope. -This can be the best stage of your life yet - just like you thought it would be when you started your training.-And most importantly, feel better in all aspects of your life without anything or anyone else having to change. Your host, Dr. Katrina Ubell, is a board-certified pediatrician and a certified life and weight loss coach. After completing her pediatric residency at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin, Dr. Ubell worked in a private pediatric practice for 10 years before retiring from her practice to become a life and weight loss coach for busy physicians. Dr. Ubell lost 45 pounds in 12 months without any surgery, pills, or unhealthy crash diets.You can find out more about Dr. Ubell and her work at www.katrinaubellmd.com. Today, I’m going to share with you a new perspective on how to think about overeating. For years, women have been shamed for being overweight—and conversely taught that we should be able to overeat. I believe that when we as women don’t lose weight because we are afraid or think that we can’t do it, we are not only holding ourselves back, but we are also holding other women back.

 You can find show notes and more information by clicking here: https://katrinaubellmd.com/158  Holding space is a term that is becoming more and more popular, and yet many people still may not understand exactly what it is. But it’s such an important tool that will bring you a more positive weight loss experience over time, so today I will be explaining what it means (from multiple perspectives) and how it applies to you and your weight loss journey.
 You can find show notes and more information by clicking here: https://katrinaubellmd.com/157 What does it take to lose weight and keep it off? Throughout my own weight loss and maintenance journey, I went from decades of not being able to stay where I wanted to be to finally finding a good, healthy place. The answer I found is a common theme that runs between my story and other weight loss success stories, and today I want to share it with you.
 You can find show notes and more information by clicking here: https://katrinaubellmd.com/156 Binge eating is something I haven’t really dug into yet on this podcast, so I’m really excited to share an inspiring and informative conversation with Megan Schenke, MD that deals with this topic. Many people say they binge and it is a commonly used term, but it’s important to understand the difference between bingeing and overeating. In this episode, Megan shares her life-long journey battling bingeing and an unhealthy mindset around food and exercise.

Wellness Evolved,"At Evolution Hospitality we care about our people and are committed to helping them to develop as a whole person. We think that when you feel good about yourself, you are in a great position to demonstrate our values and guiding principles.  The Wellness Evolved podcast is Evo's journey into our workplace wellness and mindfulness programs, answering your health questions, and featuring Evo's top leaders who embrace our culture.  Join our Chief Wellness Officer and host, Dr. Romie, who brings her unique blend of expertise in neurology, integrative medicine and mindfulness together to guide the wellness initiatives so that we can all be the best version of ourselves.  By living the Evo brand, we believe, 'it's not how we work, it's how we live."" One of the most guiding principles of Evolution Hospitality is to work with gratitude and humility. Listen to John Murphy's perspective on gratitude. ""I think there's a relationship between joy and gratitude."" He speaks of being humble and grateful as being the keys to the kingdom.
 As we come back to the holiday season, we have busy days and busy minds. Remember, gratitude rewires our brain for true happiness and joy. We will dive into how the brain processes and transforms with gratitude. I'll also teach you the psychological principles of processing gratitude. Yes! There is psychology science, which shows how gratitude can cause this type of transformation.
 What happens in your brain? First, think about what happens when you have pain, especially emotional pain and day-to-day stress. Did you know the emotional centers which process pain in our brain can only work if our pleasure system is deactivated? Temporary activities to create pleasure are eating chocolate or buying yourself something new and exciting. This gives you a temporary rush and can quickly transform into guilt, which lends your brain to experience pain.
 True pleasure, which can block the pain center in your brain, come in the form of social connections as well as gratitude. Making a habit of giving and receiving gratitude can rewire our brains for a consistent feeling of pleasure. How can we do that? Take a pause and say something you are grateful for in the past week. To stimulate the pleasure center in our brain, we have to perceive that gratitude through our senses.
 When you give thanks and gratitude, think of a specific memory that is associated with your gratitude. Think of someone on your team who you are grateful for and think of a moment with them.
 As we move forward, let's stimulate the pleasure centers of your brain by not only giving gratitude but receiving gratitude. My challenge for you: before the end of the month, find a person you work with and tell them or write them a note about why you are grateful for them.
 Could you take a pause and express this gratitude to a fellow evolutionary?
 Show Notes:

  Evolution Hospitality Mediation: Take a Team Pause As a vice president of operations, Mark Van Cooney, talks about how stress can interrupt sleep, and how mindfulness helped him welcome peaceful sleep.  Mark also introduced The Power of Pause to his children to help them not only sleep calmly but also shine in surfing competitions.
 Mark breaks down how introducing our Evo culture and mindfulness program to our new leadership teams in hotels helps us learn that ""none of us is as good as all of us.""  His leadership advice to new Evolutionaries is to start each day at a team asking, ""what are we grateful for today, and what guiding principle are we going to focus on today.""   As Campus Manager for Evolution Hospitality, Adam has worked from the ground up on our guiding principles and has been an essential figure in growing our corporate mindfulness programs, The Power of Pause.
 Adam started working for Evolution Hospitality 19 years ago. He was recruited in March of 2000 by John Murphy, who joined Tarsadia Hotels at Regency Plaza. With rebranding and renovation, they changed to DoubleTree Hotels. In 2011, the business became a part of Evolution Hospitality. Since these beginnings started with one property, we have scaled to more than 70 properties.
 Adam speaks about managing the team's performance with what the owner of the company is expecting. Dr. Romie talks about these challenges which business owners commonly deal with on a daily basis. We discuss our people-driven culture, and as we grow, these are ideals we put into practice every day. Our principles aren't just written on a wall, they are practiced with every employee at Evolution Hospitality.
 We also dive into how to carry out the principles by setting expectations, holding people to those expectations, and making them accountable. We discuss servant leadership and what this means to Adam and how he applies our principles to his servant leadership. Adam gives his advice to general managers on how they can reach out for support or use resources to be the best at their job. Taking the time to pause and listen to all the evolutionaries in our company.
 Adam discusses with Dr. Romie the importance of being your authentic self at the office and how the guiding principles translate into the day-to-day business. How Adam came up with an idea to decorate with hashtags in graffiti artwork to create a buzz about company goals and how you don't need to be a brain doctor to know that the Power of Pause works!

How do you pause to reestablish a nutrition plan and your health without missing a beat at work?

Wellness leben - Der Mediterana Experten Podcast,"Wellness leben - In diesem Podcast erhalten Sie praktische Tipps zum Entspannen, Saunieren, Wellness, Fitness und Stressabbau. Gelassener und fitter durch den Alltag gehen. Burnout vorbeugen und lange gesund leben. Sauna, Meditation, gesunde Ernährung und Wellness allgemein sind wichtig für eine gesunde Lebensweise. Das Expertenteam vom Mediterana gibt Ihnen wertvolle Tipps, die Sie sofort umsetzen können. Mit dem Glück ist das so eine Sache. Irgendwie sind wir alle auf der Suche
nach Glück.
Es gibt ohne Ende Anleitungen zum Glücklich sein und sehr viele Bücher
wurden über das Glück geschrieben. Manche Menschen scheinen das Glück
irgendwie gepachtet zu haben, andere wiederum können „glücklich sein“
nicht mal definieren, weil Sie meinen es noch nie erlebt zu haben. Die
meisten jedoch haben eine tiefe Sehnsucht danach und wünschen sich
Glück. Dabei ist es häufig nur eine Frage der eigenen Wahrnehmung, des
eigenen Denkens und Tuns.

Also Was ist GLÜCK? Das ist die ultimative Frage! Mehr Informationen: https://www.mediterana.de/
Da ist es nun: ein neues Jahr hat begonnen und neue gute Vorsätze werden sich vorgenommen! Mehr bewegen, gesünder essen, weniger Stress, weniger Arbeiten oder aufhören zu rauchen, um mal die beliebtesten guten Neujahrsvorsätze zu erwähnen. Das neue Jahr ist für viele Menschen wie ein Stichtag, sich zu verändern, an sich zu arbeiten und sich zu verbessern.
Eingeschliffene Verhaltensweisen werden überdacht und neue, ambitionierte Pläne geschmiedet. Das ist natürlich zum einen gut - doch zum anderen werden viele schon nach kurzer Zeit von der
Realität eingeholt und alle Vorsätze werden wieder über Bord geworfen.
Im Auftrag der Krankenkasse DAK-Gesundheit hat das Forsa-Institut seit 2006 bundesweit mehr als 3000 Männer und Frauen befragt. Knapp 40 Prozent der Befragten machen sich jedes Jahr Vorsätze. Doch mindestens die Hälfte oder - nach einer Untersuchung des Britischen Psychologen
Richard Wiseman - fast 90 Prozent schaffen es nicht, diese auch umzusetzen.
Doch warum ist das so?
Um einen Vorsatz wirklich umzusetzen, bedarf es einer gewissen Willensstärke und die ist in der
Großhirnrinde direkt hinter der Stirn lokalisiert, dem so genannten präfrontalen Kortex. Mehr Informationen: https://www.mediterana.de/

Waldbaden - Kraft tanken und gesund werden
Die unglaubliche Kraft von Waldbaden Sie kennen doch bestimmt das schöne Spiel aus Ihren Kindertagen:
Ich packe meinen Koffer und nehme mit....
Frei nach diesem Spiel haben wir hier im Mediterana dies mal umgesetzt
auf einen Wellnessbesuch! Demnach heißt unser Spiel bzw. unser Podcast
heute:
Ich packe meine Wellnesstasche und nehme mit...
Nachfolgend erhalten Sie einen Leitfaden, was unbedingt in Ihre
Wellnesstasche eingepackt werden muss und was nicht.
Das Mediterana-Expertenteam hat dazu eine Gliederung in 3 Kategorien
gemacht:
Pflicht – alles was unbedingt zum Wellnessbesuch mitgenommen werden
muss
Kür – alles was Sie persönlich gerne zum entspannen und wohlfühlen
brauchen
und No Go! – das gehört in keine Wellnesstasche, weil es nicht erlaubt ist.
Starten wir mit der Pflicht. Und ein paar Erklärungen vorab.
Die meisten Wellnessanlagen, so auch das Mediterana, haben eine
Hausetikette, in der gerade dieses aufgelistet ist. Mehr Informationen: https://www.mediterana.de/
Ich darf Ihnen heute etwas über ASMR erzählen.
Da haben Sie noch nichts von gehört? Oder sind Sie schon mal auf
dieses Abkürzung gestoßen?!
Auf alle Fälle hat es etwas mit Entspannung und Wohlbefinden zu tun
und ist seit einigen Jahren voll im Trend! Zumindest ist es auf Youtube
und anderen Videokanälen ein Phänomen, was sich seit ca. 2010
langsam aus dem anglo-amerikanischen Raum in der ganzen Welt
verbreitet. Es gibt dazu Videos, die Millionenfach angeschaut werden.
Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response. Abgekürzt also ASMR
bezeichnet die Erfahrung eines kribbelnden, angenehm empfundenen
Gefühls auf der Haut oder im Kopf, dass durch einen bestimmten Reiz,
auch Trigger genannt, ausgelöst wird. Es beginnt auf der Kopfhaut des
Hinterkopfs und bewegt sich entlang des Nackens und der oberen
Wirbelsäule bis in den Schulterbereich.
Eine mögliche freie deutsche Übersetzung wäre:
„Autonome Sinnesantwort“.
Um „Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response“ richtig ins Deutsche zu
übersetzen kann man die vier Wörter am besten einzeln betrachten.
Autonomous: stammt von autonom und bedeutet: von selbst, spontan
oder unkontrollierbar
Sensory: lässt sich mit sensorisch übersetzen, also Dinge die über die
Sinne aufgenommen werden
Meridian: Lässt sich mit Höhepunkt übersetzen
Response: Ist die Antwort, bzw. beim ASMR die Reaktion"

 We talk about how walking is the most natural form of movement for our bodies, and how “lifestyle walking” is likely enough exercise for many of us. We will touch on my journey back to health, which was comprised only of the most doable of steps. We might talk about some food obsessions I had in the past, and why knowing yourself is probably the biggest key to making health and wellness changes that stick. After we explore the undercurrent of a war on wellness in the media, we will clarify what I mean by the term, “wellness in the broadest sense of the word,” and how together we can pursue healthy behaviors that will enable us to live the best, most beautiful lives we ever imagined!

What the Health!?,"A podcast dedicated to helping you navigate your way towards better health-physically, emotionally and spiritually. 'Food Freedom' is definitely a buzz term that's been floating around for the past few years. But what does food freedom actually mean? In this episode, I unpack the notion of food freedom and what it could look like for you on an individual level. The goal of this episode, and this podcast, is to help you find peace towards your body and your relationship with food so you can flourish. While we often think of the environment when we hear the word 'sustainability', we often don't think about sustainability on a human level. Every time we go to the grocery store, we have access to hundreds of foods, but have you ever asked yourself where these foods come from and what really goes on in food production? Here to address some key issues in food production and consumption is Sociologist and Professor Dr. John Manzo. There are so many opinions around weighing yourself right now, and it's a controversial topic to say the least. While there has been a movement of banishing the scales, is weighing ourselves really that bad, or should we know what our weight is? In this episode, I discuss both sides of the argument so you can decide which path is right for you. One of the things I hear in client sessions is that people want to ""feel"" healthy. Health isn't just about having all our bloodwork check out to normal, it's also about feeling well. There are so many facets to being healthy, and depending on each individual, health will look different for each. In this episode, I go over different aspects of what ""good health"" can mean on varying levels. Hypothalamic amenorrhea (aka: not having a period), is so much more common than many of us realize. While being lean and fit is a good thing, if women under eat and overexercise for too long, it can have a negative effect in the body in many ways-especially when it comes to our cycle. I have gone through HA twice; the first for 4 years and the second for 10 months. In this episode, I discuss what I did to get my period back each time. I want to caveat this by saying this is my story and I worked closely with my doctor. What worked for me won't necessarily work for you, but you may be able to gain some personal insight. My advice does not replace that of your doctor and this is not a medical podcast-this is my story.

If you are going through HA, please seek care from your physician. Ah, this question: will weightlifting make me ""bulky""? I love it, but also hate the generic responses that are given-especially by personal trainers! The answer to this question is not a clear yes or no because any over generalized statement that involves a huge majority of people can never be as simple as ""yes"" or ""no"". Let's go into the reasons why the answer to this question isn't so simple!"
What's On Your Plate,"French vs English, fat vs fit. Enjoy an hour or so of Nathaniel (a personal trainer) and Renza (a girl who loves the gym but also loves pizza) talk about everything there is in life fitness, lifestyle, dieting, technology, mental health and more.

Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/AsiaStormborn/support I've been wanting to talk to Easter Grant about the realities of #tracklife as a woman for a while now. We never really get to sit and chat because she's in the Division just below mine, so during meets our schedules never align. Easter has World Titles, National Titles, and National Records, and is one of the fastest women in the Masters world! I loved getting to talk to her about her goals, what life is like as a single woman on the circuit, and how she plans to take on World Championships again next year. As expected, she delivered a real conversation about finding her WHY, and using her intuition to progress and dominate. You can find the official show notes here.

If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656 HOPE. This is a free, confidential hotline you can call 24/7.  You can also chat with the hotline online at www.rainn.org.

Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/AsiaStormborn/support This week, I chat with a woman who personifies determination. Rashida Gates has always enjoyed fitness, but it wasn't until AFTER she turned 40 that she made her mark by putting in the work and becoming a Nationally ranked Bikini competitor. What I loved about our conversation was that she didn't even realize that she was as awesome as she is. She is so genuinely humble. She also dropped the gem that I took and adapted for my life: your reward is outside of your comfort zone. Sometimes, we find our reward by listening to the coaching, mentors, and guidance that is all around us. Official Show Notes for this episode are available at www.asiastormborn.com.

Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/AsiaStormborn/support This episode ended up being longer than expected. But that's because the conversation with Rachel Guest was just that awesome. I couldn't cut anything out. This woman does so much that I was literally sweaty just trying to list everything in her introduction. Not only is she a 10-time World Champion in Masters Track &amp; Field as a Heptathlete and Hurdler, a mother of two and wife, but she also coaches Track &amp; Field and owns her own business. But I think her super secret power is getting others to believe in the outcome, and pushing us to do more. Find the Official Show Notes at www.AsiaStormborn.com

Wild Health,"Two physicians and one Regular Joe.  The biggest questions in human performance, health, and longevity answered by those in the know..  Hosted by Mike Mallin, Matt Dawson, and Jody Elliott.  www.wildhealthpodcast.com We all get injured at some point. And we are all athletes. Prepare yourself for the inevitable and try to prevent it by listening to this podcast. Anne and Mark break down their experience with injured athletes and Mike talks more than he should.  Our masters female athletes have unique physiology, and we have to start treating them that way. In this podcast, Mike and Mark interview Anne Linton, a physician, trainer, and masters athlete herself. No one is more poised to answer the tough questions regarding training masters female athletes. It may sound crazy to say we can reverse again, but it looks like someone has finally proven that it's possible…….kind of.  HERE is the really interesting study we're talking about.  To be fair, it’s a very small study, and it’s specifically of the Thymus gland.  So, it has to be taken with a grain of salt. Hey, what are you wearing?  OK, that was weird, but we do want to talk about wearable devices.

You may have noticed the 1 billion wearables and self-quantification devices on the market.  Well, we tried out every.....single......one.

OK, that's not true.  We have tried out quite a few, though, and we want to share out thoughts.

Enjoy! Pulsed electromagnetic field is a fascinating technology that seems to have a myriad of effects on the body.  It can be looked at like “cellular exercise” or a “mechanical adaptogen” as it helps the body heal and just perform better.  In this podcast episode we sit down with an expert in the field with over 20 years of experience and pick his brain. Autism is a really difficult disease.  We all know that it's on the rise.  It's also difficult in that a lot of the medications approved for autism have some pretty nasty side effects.  So, in this short podcast we talk about a nutritional tool that families can use with very little side effects.  Let food be thy medicine!"

SHOW NOTES: https://wildlyalive.com/?p=32311 We’ve been taught as women that we need to take care of everyone else and that our needs don’t matter, so when we hear things like: “Live your authentic life!” We realize, “Wow I don’t even know who I am.” This guide will help you figure that out in a fun and playful way.

Work it Out!,"Comedy podcast that explores fitness inclusivity and the emotional ups and downs of health and wellness through the point of view of two Brooklyn comedians, Megan Meadows (VH1, Reductress, Broadway.com) and Caitlin Steitzer (Union Hall, Out of Bounds Comedy Fest). Every episode we do a niche workout or class, then review/talk about the class and how we view fitness in hopes of engaging women to be more comfortable with their bodies and maintaining an active lifestyle. HELLO WORKIES HAPPY NEW YEAR! We're back with a wonderful new guest, LA based writer/performer/ and moving meditation teacher Bridgid Ryan (UCB, The Core)! We get deep in this one- talking about childhood trauma, purposeful cases of childhood mistaken identity, poop, how capitalism makes everything worse, diet culture and fat phobia, and why Bridgid no longer uses the word yoga to describe her movement work. Mego and Caitlin are back with this special holiday episode sharing their favorite tips for setting those holiday boundaries and doing that good active self-care (hint: a lot of it involves being kind to yourself and not feeling responsible for everything and everyone around you).

We also want to hear from YOU- who do you want us to feature? What’s that new workout you’ve been wanting to/have been too scared to try? Let us know- DM us on Instagram @workitoutpodcast or write it in a review! 

Happy Holidays and Happy New Years Workies! What's up Workies - we have a treat for you so nice we recorded it twice! Guest Jackie Zebrowski (Page Seven podcast, Girls are Roommates) talks about what it's like to be in a plus sized body that works out 5 days a week, what to expect when crying in public in New York, and how important community has been to her fitness journey. It's a real banger of an episode, so treat yourself and give it a listen, please! Caitlin sits down with the v v funny comedian, artist, actor and writer Julia Johns to talk about how fun a chill gym routine can be. We discuss why some of us just aren't cut out for team sports, how to take care of your knees when you run, and all of the truly terrifying things that you'll be forced to do if you ever do a 'tough mudder.'

Find more of Julia on her website www.juliajohns.com, or on the 'gram and twitter @heyjuliajohns. Caitlin is recording today with her personal hero, her mom (Victoria Bernstein)! Since her mother is visiting NYC all the way from Seattle, the two decided to sit down and discuss how fitness culture has totally changed for women over the past few decades, why weight training keeps being recommended to Victoria, and the true meaning of health and wellness. It's a fun one, Workies, so enjoy! What's UP Workies- we are delighted to be bringing you this gem of an episode with the wonderful Sahar Rizvi (Full Frontal with Samantha Bee) and her favorite work out- FHITTING ROOM! Any gym that encourages you to use the hashtag PRAY FOR ME promises to be intense, so hear our inside scoop.

Yallah Raqs,"Yallah Raqs is a podcast made to help you design YOUR personal practice by learning about the practices of others. Each guest shares their experience with their practice along with practical tips you can take away to experiment with in your own dance space. Come create a personal bellydance practice that is tailored to your life, and is just as unique as you are. I want you to keep practicing this dance, at home, on your own time, because I feel that that is where the magic happens.
 But to do so, you need to find the tools that are going to support you in that practice.
 Today I talk about what a tool actually is in your bellydance practice, and how you can find the ones that are going to work for you going forward.
 Then we'll combine the lessons from all of our days to show you how you now have all you need to move forward in your dance practice effectively.
 You can totally do this, because you're amazing! I can't wait to see how your practice evolves! Today I asked if you ever felt like an impostor.
 So, by that I mean. You wonder who on earth you are to be dancing on this stage, in this restaurant, at this hafla, even in the class that’s a level up from your normal one.
 Feelings of doubt and shame around your dance, like you don’t know enough, aren’t good enough, or hell aren’t the right size/shape/color/age for this.
 Well, you don't have to feel this way, and today we'll talk about how to make getting rid of this syndrome a part of your practice! So before we jump in. Disclaimer. I hate the word motivation.
 I straight up think it’s garbage.
 And that may not be a popular opinion, but it’s one I have none the less.
 I can’t think of a single thing that I’m motivated to do every single day. Except maybe reading. But even after a couple of days of my favorite novels, I need a bit of a break.
 If you are waiting for motivation to get you out on the dance floor that just comes from nowhere? You may be waiting a LONG time.
 Today I'm going to share how you can find Motivation and Accountability that works for YOU so that you can keep your practice going strong. Experimenting is key to figuring out how you can get yourself onto the dance floor in a consistent manner.
 Knowing yourself and what makes you tick makes it SO MUCH EASIER to make your practice stick, but you've got to figure out what that is first.
 So today, I come to you to talk about where to get started when you're trying to experiment on yourself and with your practice.
 How do you know when to get started, and how often should you check in on your experiments? How do tweak and change your practice routine so that it fits better with your life?
 Listen today to find out! You’ve learned a couple of different ways to set Goals, you’ve heard how the dance has changed as our contributors have entered it ad different times, you’ve learned about the history of zills, musicality, style, authenticity, music, I mean what HAVEN’T we covered?
 A lot.
 Here’s the thing, there is SO much to know in this dance, and most of it isn’t cut and dried.
 There are nuances, variations, multiple explanations and pathways and options.
 So today I wanted to talk to you about overwhelm and how it’s all too prevalent in our dance, and what YOU can do about it.
 Because make no mistake, this feeling holds a lot of people back. And you might be one of them without ever even noticing. Today, we’re talking a LOT about goals.
 One of the hardest things to define in our dance, since our dance is so hard to measure progress in.
 But don’t worry, because Sadie has got you covered.
 We’ll talk about what it takes to have your dance show up for you, why improv is a necessary part of your dance, why using video to practice is KEY, and of course, how to set goals and measure your progress.
 This is another interview that is just PACKED with goodies and I can’t wait for you to dive in."

An avid yoga practitioner since 2008, Lora is a eRYT 500H Yoga Alliance certified Vinyasa/Hatha/Power Yoga teacher. A grade school teacher for 14 years, sharing the practice came naturally for her when she decided to venture into teaching yoga. This year, she advanced her practice into teacher Inside Flow workshops. Gracefully moving from one posture to another, the focus on the movement between the postures allows the body to feel the rhythm of the music through the aspect of storytelling.

Yoga Off The Mat - The Movement For Modern Life Podcast,"Kat, Founder of Movement for Modern Life, the UK's online yoga platform, meets Champions of Change and Leaders in their Field. Those who are taking yoga off the mat, transforming lives and inspiring us to take the small steps to live a happy, healthy and more sustainable live to make a difference. Movement for Modern Life's mission is for all of us to Move Move. Live More. Featuring the very best teachers and thousands of classes on our platform, we believe in moving thoughtfully through life both on the yoga mat and in our daily lives. This is more than just about moving with our bodies, it’s about moving with the times. We are meeting the experts and the champions and are on a journey of discovery to learn, discover and move towards a better life and a better world.movementformodernlife.com Being a parent is the hardest job in the world, but also one of the most rewarding. With motherhood comes so many expectations, so much advice and so much pressure, that it is often an overwhelming time, which is compounded by sleep deprivation, lack of free time and adjusting to a whole new way of life. So how can yoga help navigate pregnancy, birth and parenthood? 



In episode 18, Kat chats to Nikita, one of our most popular teachers, about how her yoga practice has supported her after the arrival of her second baby and how it has changed on her journey through motherhood. 



Parenting and yoga go hand in hand; being a parent provides an opportunity to utilise the tools, such as being mindful, aware, gentle and self-compassionate, you learn as a yogi. While, parenthood can lead us to approach our yoga practice in a new way. One thing is for sure, Nikita is not sure how she would have  managed pregnancy, birth and parenthood without the magic of yoga. 



One of the biggest lessons of parenthood is to know what it is to surrender to life and change, and the beauty of yoga is that it teaches us how to ride that wave of change.

“If all of us do something very small, it becomes something very big.” 







Life is overwhelming, full on and busy. It’s a rollercoaster out there; we're constantly bombarded with news and information as we try to navigate our way through the peaks, troughs, twists and turns of life. So, in Episode 17 of our podcast, Kat sits down with our Content Creator, Rakhee, to talk about the small steps we can all make towards a healthier, happy, more sustainable life. 







There's lots of energy in the new year as people set 'resolutions' and vow to make big changes for the year ahead, which can feel too much for many of us. So, join Kat and Rakhee as they talk through the things the Movement For Modern Life team are doing this January to set themselves up for the year ahead without the pressure and overwhelm. 







Change can be difficult and challenging, but be inspired by the small changes Kat and Rakhee have made which have gone on to have a huge impact on their lives. Get practical tips on the small steps YOU can take to instigate change, hear snippets of wisdom to support you during those changes and be motivated by our power to impact others. 







Kat and Rakhee will share their tools for coping when life gets busy and stressful, how we can break down our goals to more manageable chunks, and maybe even move away from the concept of goals!







It's time to forget new year's resolutions and instead think about intentions, gratitude and awareness. According to Kat, “there’s no self-improvement, there its no ‘best’ version of yourself, it’s just uncovering the real you.” January is a time for nourishing and nurturing, quiet and rest; time to make changes to rediscover and celebrate yourself.

Getting older is something we all think about, and maybe even get anxious about, but age does not have to limit us. In Episode 16 of Champions of Change, we look at how the inspiration between mother and daughter has transformed the life of 78-year-old Vera Farrants.



TIP: Do you want to experience the exercises that Vera mentioned in this episode? Enjoy Andrea’s classes (and all other classes) for FREE for 14 days here: https://movementformodernlife.com/signup



Vera is the mother of Movement for Modern Life founder, Kat, and though she only recently came to yoga at the age of 73, she doesn’t see that as a bad thing. Instead, the older you are, the more you can benefit. In fact, her practice has not only helped her physically, but transformed her attitude to and outlook on life, and taught her the importance of letting go.



There are certain difficulties which come with age, but we must not put ourselves into a “little old box”. For many, the ageing process can feel like a limitation rather than an opportunity, so it’s time to flip that assumption on its head. After a long and successful career, working hard and travelling, it became clear Vera had not been looking after herself physically. A stint with a personal trainer didn’t quite hit the spot, so after talking with Kat, she took yoga classes in her home, then started going on retreats. Physically, her practice has impacted the osteoporosis in her body, improved lower back pain and developed her strength and mobility (she can even do crow pose)!



But, it was the philosophy of yoga which has really taken hold in her life, and has instigated a radical transformation. How many of us never let it go? Where once Vera thought holding on to the past made her stronger, she now sees yoga as an outlet to logically and calmly address her issues and let the past be. Age is no barrier to learning new ways of living; you can be active, you can be creative, you can give and you can be kind to yourself. In this episode, Vera talks about her increased self awareness, reflects on the challenges of motherhood and explains just what makes the yoga community so special. Her advice to anyone who thinks they are too old for yoga? Do not limit yourself; “grasp the moment and the beauties of life, enjoy everything around you, notice it.” But above all, you are never too old to be a student, so do not fear the mat, “if you do an hour of yoga, you feel so good, so happy.”



Kat and Vera chat about…



How Vera came to yoga (4:50)



Letting go (6:05)

“It does you more harm if you’re destructive about a thought than if you just give way and just let it wash over you”



Laughing at yourself (12:36)

“If I can’t do it, I just laugh at myself”



Age and Osteoporosis (15:20)



The Yoga Community (21:25)

“It’s very special and very giving, very pleasant to be with as it’s not competitive”



Lower Back Pain (22:25)

Hamstring exercises to support the back



Self Awareness and Motherhood (23:10)

If you want to know more about how to get older gracefully, don’t miss Vera’s comments on self-awareness



The Fact You’re Not Too Old! (30:40)



The Joy of Life (35:10)

Our first guest, Dan Peppiatt, is somewhat of a maverick when it comes to teaching and talking about yoga. Join us as we take a deep dive into his unique perspective on life and learn how living a little differently can help us through not just the Christmas festivities, but anytime we struggle, stumble or question ourselves What’s the best way to eat for optimal health? What’s the best nutrition to support the body through the menstrual cycle and the menopause? Listen in for this fascinating discussion with Founder of Wild Nutrition, Henrietta Norton, to find out the best things to eat to reduce symptoms around periods and menopause and increase fertility and your feeling of wellbeing. 'There’s nothing more dangerous than a woman being kind to herself'



Episode 13 of our Champions of Change Series features Alexandra Pope and Sjanie Hugo Wurlitzer, Founders of Red School talking to Kat, Founder of MFML. This is a fun and furious episode, full of revelations and revolutions, with two radical champions of change - changing the way women understand and live in our own bodies."
Yoga Pose Podcast,"Don't know your Asana from your elbow? Or think Karma is what happens when things don't go your way?​In these fun and thought provoking episodes I share more of myself and make the theory of yoga and mediation feel accessible.​I do all the reading of texts, and package the teachings up into fun and playful episodes.  Expect story telling, insights from my own life and mediation practices which have all helped me loosen up! Value hierarchy is a fancy way of listing what you like to do for fun. What do you enjoy, how much do you value that? And have you noticed how your value hierarchy has changed over time?

Yoga with Adam,"Practise yoga at home with sessions range from short and focused on specific regions of the body to full-length live classes from my teaching in London. Browse through the archives to find classes focusing on feet, outer hips, quads and hip flexors, shoulders, core and more! Students frequently use this resource to keep a practice going at home or while on vacation and away from their home studio. Enjoy this yoga podcast and let me know if you have any specific requests. Check out archives at adamyogapodcast.comPlease see the health and safety disclaimer (adamhocke.com/health-and-safety-disclaimer). By listening to this podcast, you agree to its conditions and practice at your own risk. This is a straight forward practice to develop Eka Pada Galavasana, commonly referred to as ‘Flying Pigeon Pose.’ We will do a bit of hip warm-up, the shape on our back, a little flow, and then use bricks to help us fold into it, and then take them away and see how we go. Remember the stages of the pose are (see photos below):







* Raise heel off floor

* Raise bottom foot up, heel to bum

* Lift bottom knee away from body and back

* Straighten bottom leg away – balancing reach of leg back with reach of chest forward







You will need two bricks, although you can practise without them.

Yin Yoga Class that focuses on the Hips and the shoulders.

Yin Yoga is a perfect practice to encourage more flexibility within the body. It's also a great meditative practice...but I am not saying its easy! It can be very challenging to practice Yin Yoga. I recommend you do Yang to make sure you still strengthen and tone at the same time as working with Yin Yoga. Happy Yin Yoga-ing my loves.

After finishing his collegiate career he signed with a professional basketball team in Germany, but ended up suffering an ACL injury 3 days prior to departure. Unknowingly at the time, that was one of the best things that has ever happened to him and his path in life. Enjoy!

Young Blood (Men’s Health Matters),"This is a series focused on starting conversations about young men's health. Young Blood has been inspired by wanting to do something about the extremely high rates of suicide among men aged 15 to 45 and the need to create an environment for men to talk openly and honestly about the topics that impact all aspects of our health. Taylor Johnstone is a nationally recognised leader in the youth mental health space.
He's a former youth research council member at Orygen, the National Centre of Excellence in Youth Mental Health and an ambassador for Victorian charity 'Youth Live4Life'. His mission is to educate young people about mental health with the goal of improving wellbeing and preventing suicide.
Taylor has survived his own struggle with suicidality and is now deeply passionate about helping others through early intervention.
 
In this intense conversation, he opens up about his story, the hardships and pain he's gone through and the great joy he now feels in being alive. Loveable larrikins Ben Harvey and Liam Stapleton are the now popular hosts of the Triple J Breakfast Show, one of the biggest radio gigs in Australia, but it wasn't always that way.
The boys moved to Sydney to take over the job in their early twenties after quickly catapulting onto the national stage and were immediately faced with a barrage of heavy abuse from listeners that even included death threats. They endured many months of brutal criticism that nearly brought them to breaking point, but they weathered the storm to eventually earn the respect of their audience and gain bulletproof confidence in themselves.
In this upbeat chat they talk about the highs and lows that've come with going a such a long way in a short time, as well as their own approaches to mental health and how they manage to perform under pressure every day with the ears of the nation listening.
  @markhealthmattiazzo is a personal trainer and online health coach, dedicated to making people fitter and healthier from the inside out.
He's a vocal advocate for the need to take care of our minds and bodies and approach fitness for the right reasons.
But that hasn't always been a priority, it's a lesson Mark learned the hard way after abusing steroids, spiraling out of control and bringing himself back from the brink.
In this revealing conversation he gives a no holds barred insight into his darkest days and the reality of using steroids.
Mark is down to earth, engaging and genuine in telling it like it is.  He's not afraid to shed an ugly light on the elephant in the room topic that many in the fitness industry shy away from.  This episode also features a separate chat with world renowned endocrinologist, Professor Gary Wittert. He was kind enough to break down the facts about steroids and testosterone, answering many of the scientific questions that loom large. Stephen Harfield dropped into the studio to break down the issues surrounding indigenous health. 
He’s spent his career so far working to improve access to health services for indigenous people and close the gap between indigenous and non-indigenous rates of mental and physical illness. 
Stephen has been a researcher at the Health Department of SA Aboriginal Health Division and is currently a Research Fellow at the Wardliparingga Aboriginal Research Unit at SAHMRI.
He has some insightful points to make about the impact of racism on health and tells the story of how his experience of growing up shaped his passion today. Hundreds of thousands of Australian men identify as homosexual and many more still hide it... Zane Dean and Brandon Symes are two good friends who've had quite different journeys towards defining themselves as young gay men.
They visited the studio together to lay it all out for us, covering the full spectrum of gay life from the anxiety of coming out to the beauty of learning to love yourself and be who you are.
These guys don't hold back discussing what some might consider the more uncomfortable aspects of homosexuality.  It's an enlightening conversation with heart and lots of laughs that might teach you a thing or two about yourself or someone in your life. They don't come tougher than Hugo Toovey.
At just 27 he's endured more suffering than most will in their lifetime. He put his budding career as an army officer on hold to battle testicular cancer and won, only to be struck down by bowel cancer 5 years later.
But despite all that, he's still standing and he's not one to complain or see the glass half empty. Instead he's deadset on doing everything in his power to help other young men take responsibility for their health before it's too late. He does this in a big way as co-host of his own podcast '25 Stay Alive' which is also worth your time.
Hugo made time for this conversation, despite preparing for yet another major surgery, in the hope that it'll encourage others to go to the doctor if they think something isn't right. That's the kind of man he is.
Hugo is one of the most inspirational people I've had the pleasure of speaking to. But he's humble and wouldn't want to be thought of as anything more than a guy trying to get what he can out of life and make a difference.
He will fire you up to make the most of what you’ve got and not take your health for granted."

I subtracted a lot of things from my life &gt; let go of clients, parted ways with different programs, let go of values that weren’t serving me, release patterns and habits that were not bringing me towards my highest self Patterns: overthinking, asking for advice, overworking, overconsuming social media, “excellence” value, people-pleasing (undercharging)I discovered &amp; allowed myself to be more of who I am &gt; I traveled a lot more, I stepped out of my comfort zone, I invested in myself with masterminds and retreats, 
2020
Word of the year:
Joy &gt; does this make me happy? Does this feel good? Do I want to do this? Goals:
Lead with integrity &gt; be an example of true leadership for my clients and community. That means being offline what I preach online &gt; self-care, self-love, my highest self. Not just posting motivational quotes and then being a lazy person at home. NOt preaching self love if I’m not living a life of love Step outside my comfort zone daily &gt; push myself beyond the current paradigm I live in. For me this looks like Mission:
Change the conscious collective of the fitness industry from dieting and hating their body to focusing on their mindset, personal development, and self-growth. Shifting the conscious collective is going to wake women up all over the world who have been so focused on getting into a smaller body to instead pursue their secret dream and make this world a better place. We need you as a leader, author, innovator, mom, executive and change maker.  To wrap up this year I wanted to talk about what we can do to make our lives better &amp; create a life that's worth living. I personally had the toughest year of my life from a personal and professional stance, however, you wouldn’t think so looking from the outside in. That’s because most of the things that make life worth living are the tough inner work that we all push to the side. But when you do the work, your outside world falls into place for you.
In today's episode you're going to learn:

Chanee Notes:
We are CREATING our purpose not finding it :) 
The Law of Dharma is the 7th and last law in Deepak Chopra’s Seven Spiritual Laws of Success. Everyone has a purpose in life . . . a unique gift or special talent to give to others.In the Law of Dharma, Deepak Chopra asks us to: “Seek your higher Self. Discover your unique talents. Ask yourself how you are best suited to serve humanity. Using your unique talents and serving others brings unlimited bliss and abundance.”Passion: an intense desire or enthusiasm for something. Purpose: the reason for which something is done or created or for which something exists &gt;&gt; “At its core, the idea of purpose is the idea that what we do matters to people other than ourselves.”― Angela Duckworth, GritSometimes your purpose will have passion, sometimes it wont. Don’t get trapped into looking that your passion has to be your purpose or that BOTH have to bring you income. “Three bricklayers are asked: “What are you doing?” The first says, “I am laying bricks.” The second says, “I am building a church.” And the third says, “I am building the house of God.” The first bricklayer has a job. The second has a career. The third has a calling.”― Angela Duckworth, Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance3 questions for finding your purposeLooking back on my life, what is the ONE MAIN underlying theme of all that I’ve done and accomplished with joy for others? As a kid, teen, adult etc?Which part of my current job do I love doing and would continue to do even if I didn't get paid?  &gt;&gt; need to have enthusiasm for the long run, compass vs fireworkWhat is my super power?What’s going to hold you back?Thinking your purpose is meant to make you money and making it about money Not taking action Not having perseverance and grit Not believing in yourself, thinking you don’t deserve it &amp; not thinking you’re good enoughSocietal norms "

Tune in to the latest research, interviews with exercise, diet and medical professionals, and an entertaining mash-up of ancestral wisdom and modern science, along with Q&A's and mind-body-spirit optimizing content from America's top personal trainer. Every week, as part of his speaker series, world famous chef David Bouley brings in a physician or other guest expert to present on a topic or to answer questions, and each series is accompanied by a fabulous 5 star, multi-course meal that is both amazingly healthy and delicious.

I always enjoy giving these talks, and decided to record this one for your listening pleasure. Enjoy! I recently spoke at The Assemblage in New York City, revealing my top tips, tricks and biohacks for optimizing mind, body and spirit - including everything from neurotransmitters to the blood brain barrier to fat loss/muscle gain tips, a 20 minute Q&amp;A and much more!

Show notes are at bengreenfieldfitness.com/assemblage You are far more than average. The power to operate at your full human capacity already exists inside you, just waiting to be unleashed. My new book will teach you exactly how.

I've received plenty of questions about Boundless, including who it's for, what kind of routines and plans are included in it, more specifics on chapter content, and much more.

So in this special solosode, I'll answer a few of your burning questions related to the book!

Show notes: bengreenfieldfitness.com/boundlessqa Last year I spoke at an event called ""A4M"" in Las Vegas. My entire presentation was focused on 32 different ways to increase testosterone naturally, with no injections or hormone replacement protocols required. I'm not against bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT), but I do think one should explore as many natural alternatives as possible first. Or, for even more bang for the buck, pair BHRT with the tactics you'll discover in this episode. "" is dedicated to the advancement of tools, technology, and transformations in healthcare that can detect, treat, and prevent diseases associated with aging. They promote the research of practices and protocols that have the potential to optimize the human aging process. The organization is also dedicated to educating healthcare professionals and practitioners, scientists, and members of the public on biomedical sciences, breakthrough technologies, and medical protocols through our advanced education entity: Metabolic Medical Institute (MMI). Their event in Vegas each year is, in my opinion, well worth checking out. Recently, in two separate papers, testosterone therapy has gotten a bad rap  and ), and been blamed as a culprit for coronary artery disease and stroke risk, but , this is simply not true. As a matter of fact, in Jay's , he clearly lays out the research behind optimized testosterone levels improving heart health, optimizing cognitive function, combatting Alzheimer's disease, staving off bone loss, and much much more. My friend Carl Lenore also recently addressed some of this unfair testosterone vilification in . Furthermore, as I explain in the introduction to this podcast, I recently began to use microdoses of testosterone cream (compounded by ) in the morning and evening to simulate the natural diurnal release of testosterone, and have noted a profound impact in my own energy levels and recovery (although this is not a strategy I endorse as a ""bandaid"" but instead the icing-on-the-cake for males in their late 30's and beyond once all other foundational practices I outline in this podcast are established). Incidentally, my wife is now using progesterone from Dr. Koniver for similar purposes. In this episode, I will review the key biomarkers for achieving peak male health, along with the most potent and effective practices for optimizing biological variables for men's fertility and longevity. I will also unveil a host of little-known biohacks proven to enhance or restore peak testosterone and libido, along with how to practically implement a blend of ancestral wisdom and modern science to amplify sexual performance. You'll discover a multimodal approach to optimizing male sexual performance, learn how to identify key biomarkers to assess male health and get the best ancient practices and modern scientific strategies that enhance or restore men's fertility and longevity. Oh, and by the way, women need testosterone too, and all these tactics will work for the ladies as well.  In this episode, you'll learn... -Research I've encountered since I last spoke on this topic on the podcast...2:00  Microdosing testosterone cream (transdermal application)  Simulates diurnal increase of testosterone (vs. a sudden increase via an injection) Overseen by a knowledgeable doc Morning and evening small amount of cream (not gel)          -Workout Strategies to Optimize Testosterone...12:43 Sprint  Study:      Lift heavy stuff  Article:  Study:  Workouts:  , , ,  Article:    Book:    Use long rest periods  Study:   Do forced reps  Study:  Article:   Use your legs   Study:  Article:  Article:   Avoid chronic cardio  Study:  Podcast:   -Notoriously Missing Nutrients That Drastically Affect Testosterone Levels...21:46 Magnesium   Podcast:   Vitamin D     Book:     Zinc      DHEA  Article:     Creatine    Boron   Article:    -Herbal Add-Ons...32:39          -Biohackin Good news: Gut fungi respond quickly and dramatically to dietary and lifestyle changes.

For over thirty years, Paul’s unique, integrated approach to treatment and education has changed the lives of many of his clients, his students, and their clients.

Chasing Excellence,"Chasing Excellence is a show dedicated to dissecting what it means to live a life of excellence, both inside the gym & out. On each episode, we'll deep dive on various aspects of being an athlete & maximizing your potential. This week's 3x3 is looking at mistakes I think everyone should make, shortcuts to assessing overall health, &amp; self-development books I've found helpful. We're answering a few listener questions this week about how to respond to people who don't get why you're dedicating your time and energy to something they don't understand (like trying to make it to the CrossFit Games). Another 2:00 Drill this week, covering questions about cheat meals, getting the most out of what you're reading, and tips on gaining weight. We're going behind the scenes of my recent TEDx talk, talking about the kind of prep I did, the process of cutting it from 50 minutes to 12, and what it was like working with a coach. We're back with another 3x3! This week, we're talking about 3 things I recommend everybody do every morning, 3 tips for parents of teenagers, and 3 ways to stop being so addicted to your phone. We're answering a listener question today about responding to adversity, the balance between staying Stoic &amp; being complacent, &amp; how to know when you're reaching for something beyond your control."

50% Facts,"Life’s too short to be half right! Veteran podcasters Mike ""Silent Mike"" Farr and Jim McDonald try to answer a single question without any research – then ask an expert what they got right or wrong. Any question is fair game, but most involve health, fitness, nutrition, mental health, culture…even sex. They walk away with a better sense of the facts…and so do you. Business inquiries: Jim@thejimmcd.com In a “just us” episode, we take a look at a couple articles claiming to track the top fitness trends for 2020 – notably one from Men’s Health.

We start by talking about the personal, and cultural, impacts of the deaths of Kobe Bryant and his fellow passengers lost in Sunday’s helicopter crash. How did Kobe change after retirement? Is it possible to be too driven? When people publicly mourn the death of a celebrity, what are people really reacting to? Some programs claim to have been written for beginning lifters. Others for intermediates, etc. How do you when you’re past the beginner stage, and how much does it really matter?

We asked Greg Nuckols to break it down for us. Does women’s training really need an entirely different approach or just a couple tweaks?

We asked Greg Nuckols, someone who recently wrote an article on this topic, to break it down for us. New Year. New avalanche of fitness and nutrition-related studies to confuse the resolutionistas (and the rest of us). How are we supposed to decide which ones to believe?

We asked Greg Nuckols, someone who spends a lot of time evaluating research, to break it down for us. The next regular episode will drop on Jan 8, but we thought we’d have some fun and throw in this holiday bonus episode.

We both saw “The Rise of Skywalker” so we talked through our thoughts and opinions. We also used the Business Insider’s ranking to discuss our thoughts on all the Star Wars films.

There are tons of spoilers, so beware if you haven’t seen the movie yet! We take a look back at all of this year’s happenings and episodes. We talk about our favorite episodes of the year, our favorite answers from experts, and the answers we got the MOST wrong.

Thanks to everyone who listened and special thanks to all our experts!

Plant Proof - Plant Based Nutrition &amp; Inspirational Stories,"The Plant Proof Podcast, hosted by Simon Hill, is about connecting with like-minded & inspirational people to share their story, advice and experience.  By listening to their stories & wisdom together we can become more mindful & conscious of how we are living and the impact everyday decisions have on our health, the planets health and all of those that we share it with.  Show host Simon is a Qualified Physiotherapist, Certified in Plant Based Nutrition and is currently completing a Masters in Nutrition.  In addition Simon is writing a book that will be published by Penguin in 2020 - with all of his proceeds being donated to charity. To connect with Simon you can find him on Instagram @plant_proof. In Episode 90 I sit down with former President of the American College of Cardiology Dr Kim Williams to discuss the role that our diet plays in the preventing, suspending and reversing cardiovascular disease. If you want to know what foods are causing your arteries to 'clog' and how to avoid this then I highly recommend listening to this exchange.  Kim is an absolute wealth of knowledge and unlike so much of what you see on social media these days, his stance is based on the totality of evidence - not anecdotes and not theories but hard evidence from all different levels of scientific investigation.

The simple fact is that many of us see heart attacks and strokes as 'inevitable' and a 'normal' part of getting old but this couldn't be further from the truth. Many populations who choose to eat differently to us are significantly less likely to develop cardiovascular disease. And it's not just observational science that points to a plant exclusive or predominant diet as the ultimate way to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, with several controlled trials reaching the same conclusion. Some of which we talk about in this episode.

Born and trained in Chicago, Dr Williams was a professional level tennis player and coach before choosing rather to pursue a career in cardiology. Since 2013, he has headed up the cardiology department of Rush University Medical Center - where many of his colleagues have also found their way to adopting a plant-based diet.

Dr Williams has served on numerous committees and boards at the United States national level, including - but certainly not limited to - the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the American Medical Association. Among other presidencies throughout his distinguished career, Dr Williams was the 2016 President of American College of Cardiology.

Kim is the inaugural Editor in Chief of the International Journal of Disease Reversal and Prevention (IJDRP). This new journal has been created to document the science of nutrition and lifestyle to prevent, suspend and reverse disease.

Kim is also on the 'International ​Advisory Council​' for Doctors For Nutrition - a wonderful Australian organisation dedicated to helping equip healthcare practitioners, institutions and the public with evidence-based information and education on optimum human nutrition. As mentioned during this episode if you are from Adelaide or can get to Adelaide on Feb 2nd 2020 to listen to Dr Kim Williams, along with a host of other speakers, at the Doctors for Nutrition Symposium I highly recommend it - you can get tickets here.

Specifically we cover: 

 • The prevalence of cardiovascular disease
 • Kim's path to Medicine
 • Nutrition training during Medical School
 • Being elected President of the American College of Cardiology
 • The difference between the ACC/AHA guidelines and the USDA dietary guidelines
 • The role of industry in effecting guidelines
 • How he explains to patients the importance of changing their diet
 • What dietary components increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis (narrowing of the artery with plaque build up)
 • Why LDL cholesterol is an independent risk factor
 • What a heart healthy diet looks like
 • Changes he would like to see in the 2020 USDA dietary guidelines 
 • Government policy changes he would like to see
 • The types of foods he likes to eat in his own diet
 • and much much more

RESOURCES:

1 - Jupiter study - we spoke about this when discussing LDL cholesterol and inflammation
2 - A second study to look at on LDL cholesterol as an independent risk factor
3 - The ACC/AHA 2019 guidelines - The Predimed Trial we spoke about is discussed within these guidelines. Pay special attention to the PRO-Vegetarian aspect of that paragraph.  Essentially, those within the Mediterranean Diet group who ate les In Episode 89 I sit down with a long time friend of mine, Sean Ryan. Sean and I recently caught up for dinner and he expressed interest in changing his lifestyle. Particularly given that cardiovascular disease runs in his family and he is ticking quite a few of the boxes when it comes to modifiable risk factors for having a heart attack or stroke.

In fact lifestyle changes are something that Sean has been embarking on for the better part of a year with mixed results. He cannot help but feel confused by all of the mixed messages that that exist across the internet and among health professionals in his community and in many respects has been left feeling disempowered and unsure what to do. As Sean and I got talking during our dinner I realised how valid his questions were and suggested we shared our conversations, and his journey to better health, as a series on this show to hopefully inspire others. He generously agreed and here we are - the first of a handful of episodes with Sean.

In this episode we cover:

1 - Why Sean wants to change his lifestyle
2 - We hear bit's and pieces about Sean's past and life growing up
3 - Why he is confused about what to eat
4 - Why some of the things I say are evidence based are different to what the Heart Association recommend
5 - Answers to questions he has about a plant-based diet
6 - A plan from here

Over the course of the next few months I will upload follow up conversations with Sean where we check back in, get an update, go through any questions he has and make plans for the next period. In the next episode we will be discussing his baseline blood tests, his first grocery experience, how he is feeling physically and mentally, what it's been like creating meals without animal products and of course any new questions that he has.

Slightly different format that I hope you enjoy. If you do, please share the episode on social media (I know Sean would love your support) and leave a review on the Apple Podcast app. Either or both would be greatly appreciated!

Happy listening friends,

Book coming out 2020 published with Penguin that I cannot wait to share with you (all proceeds being donated to charity) In Episode 88 I sit down with Seb Alex to talk about the importance of animal welfare and what life looks like through the lens of an Animal Activist.

Specifically we cover:

 • Normalising veganism
 • The impossible burger: Does he eat it and what does he think about their practices?
 • Things to consider when supporting large chains like Hungry Jacks who have added vegan burgers onto their menu
 • What is a vegan?
 • What is a sentient being?
 • Different levels of sentience
 • Are oysters sentient beings?
 • What is speciesism?
 • Growing up in Lebanon and his transition to a vegetarian diet and then ultimately a vegan diet
 • Is veganism extreme?
 • Developing the courage to be an activist
 • The notion of 'humane' slaughter - does it exist?
 • Ag-Gag laws protecting the animal agriculture industry
 • and much much more

I completely understand this episode and the topic of animal welfare is often a little uncomfortable (I totally get it) and perhaps you have a stereotypical view of an animal activist being angry, weird and violent. I know I used to. Today's guest, Animal Activist Seb Alex, is anything but that and I urge all of you, vegan or not, to listen to this conversation with an open mind. Even if you're not interested in veganism it's interesting to listen to what people from different walks of lives have to say...how they see the world. 10 years ago if I came across this podcast - I would probably keep scrolling. In fact I definitely would of. I often think about my early University days and why I never stopped to think about eating animal products. I grew up loving dogs and farm animals...but I never once fully appreciated the connection between my food plate with an animals life and how my consumption affected their happiness. The odd thing is I look back on myself a decade ago and I see the same person...the values and beliefs were there but I was closed. I was not in a place to allow new ideas to challenge the way I had been programmed.

Now that I understand the power of opening your mind I have discussions with people all the time who see things differently to me not just about nutrition but all things in life. I can escape the echo chamber that we so often comfortably find ourselves in. A place where there is the natural tendency to only surround yourself with people who share your thoughts. I always walk away from these conversations. Happy that they give me the opportunity to challenge my beliefs and think a little deeper. Happy they gave me an opportunity to learn something new. It's these types of conversations that allow our minds to expand. You may find todays message resonates with you. You may find it takes you to places in your mind that you have never visited. You may find it doesn't. The point is, you will be better informed with regards to how an animal activist sees the world, you will better understand their perspective and then with that you can do what you want! If this isnt an episode for you right now -thats completely fine, jump over to any number of previous episodes on nutrition and come back to this one when it feels right.

WHOOP Podcast,"At WHOOP, we are on a mission to unlock human performance. We measure the body 24/7 and provide detailed analytics to our members regarding strain, recovery, sleep, HRV and more. Our clients range from the best professional athletes in the world, to Navy SEALs, to fitness enthusiasts, to Fortune 500 CEOs and executives. The common thread among WHOOP members is a passion to improve. What does it take to optimize performance for athletes, for executives, for anyone? We've launched this podcast to dig deeper. WHOOP Founder & CEO Will Ahmed interviews a variety of athletes, experts and industry leaders. Your greatest recovery amplifier: Naps. Kristen Holmes and Emily Capodilupo discuss the physical and mental benefits to napping, the concept of sleep debt and how naps help offset it, plus how to incorporate your activities and day strain into planning the timing and duration of your naps. Pro Spartan racer Rebecca Hammond discusses the sport of obstacle course racing and how WHOOP has helped her become one of the world's best in such a short time. Why is sleep important? Kristen Holmes and Emily Capodilupo discuss the benefits of REM and slow wave sleep, effects of sleep deprivation, how much sleep you need, and the best ways to maximize the efficiency of your time in bed. With the passing of the NBA Commissioner Emeritus David Stern, a cherished WHOOP advisor and investor, we've re-released the very first episode of our podcast, which serves as a fitting retrospective on David's life. Learnings from a year of WHOOP data: Mike Lombardi and Emily Capodilupo discuss what days people are best recovered, when they get the most sleep, behavior trends, training patterns and more. Combat pilot turned entrepreneur Pierre-Henri ""Ate"" Chuet discusses the mental state necessary to succeed as a fighter pilot, and how he applies the lessons learned to the business world."

 Follow us on Instagram @brute.strength. This week on the Brute Strength Podcast I’m interviewing a Powerlifting legend, Jim Wendler. At his best Jim had a 1000lb squat, 675lb bench and 700lb deadlift, weighing in at 275lb. Jim is also the creator of the 5/3/1 method, one of the most successful strength programs to date. In this episode we get into his early days at University of Arizona Football, lifting, training, competing,  and of course coaching. Jim is a great story teller so it was definitely a pleasure to hear him get into some topics like why he created the 5/3/1 method and the importance of keeping things simple in life and in training in order to become a true master. Enjoy the show.

Muscle Intelligence,"Formerly the Muscle Expert Podcast. The world’s top authority on intelligent muscle building and fat loss gives us a simple to understand deep dive into the complex world of building a body you love, and living your greatness. Weekly interviews with leading experts in a vast number of scientific fields focusing on health optimization (nutrition, sleep, hormones, mindfulness and mind set), strength, (both physical and mental), and muscle hypertrophy.

Ladies, this podcast is for you too. The topics, tips, and life hacks covered are essential for every individual who wants to upgrade themselves mentally and physically. Today on the Muscle Intelligence Podcast we are joined by Dr. Harry Adelson from Docere Clinics in Salt Lake City. Dr. Adelson educates listeners on stem cells, from their function in the body to the procedures that leverage their healing capabilities. He explains the process of isolating stem cells and injecting them for optimization, emphasizing the role of the “superhuman” mesenchymal stem cells and the communicative function of exosomes. We take a deep dive into the full body stem cell makeover, with Dr. Adelson explaining who the procedure is designed for, the sedation options, what pain or discomfort patients can expect afterward, when they should start seeing results, and the costs involved. Tuning in to this episode, you will also learn more about keeping your stem cells healthy, the lifespan of stem cells in the body, the role of Wharton’s jelly, and the difference between bone marrow and fat in terms of stem cell concentration.

His name is Milos Sarcev, and possibly one of the most aesthetically pleasing physiques to ever walk the earth. Milos is one of Ben’s biggest mentors and certainly one of the hardest working athletes our host has ever worked with.
 Today, Milos talks about his radical devotion to building muscle, which involved obsessive journaling and massive intakes of protein offset by equally extreme workouts. Milos was able to maintain perfect condition in each one of his 77 competitions, and today he shares some of what it took to achieve that, including his unique approach to hyperemia. We also hear from Milos about how he took Hidetada Yamagishi to Mr. Olympia in spite of wide skepticism through the use of his brutal training schedules. If you couldn't keep up with Milos back then, he would simply kick you out of the gym. We also talk about our upcoming muscle camps which will combine Milos’s giant sets with Ben’s form focussed styles, a combination that will no doubt lead to mind-blowing shifts in the way you think about working out.

This is not an ""anti-chicken"" in a ""we are killing chickens"" kind of way (the moviemakers seem to understand you need to kill them to eat them). You do see where these birds are raised and bred to gain so much weight so fast that they often have heart attacks - and that is seen as a good thing.

 see www.supportthisshow.com I started the year at 225.3 and after losing a few pounds, I'm back to 226. This is partly due to me going out of town for the weekend. I tried to do things like skip breakfast and I even exercised one day. None the less my scale went up when I got home. With this in mind, I got up today and exercised early. 
 MY NOT SO LUCKY GREEN SUIT
 I had to wear a suit to a speaking gig and I hadn't worn a suit in a while. To make a long story short none of my suits fit. I'm at least 20 lbs heavier than I was when I last wore a suit. 
 The fun part of this is there is only one person blame. I was not a fan of myself at that moment. I took that time and turned off my phone, TV, computer and just took some time to embrace how bad this felt. I DO NOT WANT TO FEEL THIS WAY. It hurt. 
 WHY CAN'T WE GET UP TO EXERCISE
 To get to Boston I had to get up at 5:30 AM which is EARLY for me (very early). Yet, when the alarm went off I got up in a slight panic, took a shower, finished packing, and got out the door on time.
 WHY? Because I had to. I had one shot to make my flight. If I missed my flight, I didn't have the money for another ticket or fee to get another ticket.
 WE NEED TO KEEP THE SENSE OF URGENCY
 We need to think of the opportunities we have to do the right thing as a plane. We have ONE SHOT to get it right and embrace that urgency and do the right thing. 
 NOTHING feels as good as watching the scale go down on a consistent basis. No taste gives you that feeling. 
 You're smart.
 You know the lies we tell ourselves.
 Quit listening to the lies. 
 You can do hard things (you do every day).
 Consider me your uber driver here to take you to the airport to catch the plan to onederland.  I started the year at 225.3 and after losing a few pounds, I'm back to 225. It's frustrating. I was doing good, but by skipping a few days and not really paying attention to my calories, and not exercising they came right back.
 The other thing that is killing me is a lack of sleep. My ears ring all the time and have for years, but for some reason, it's starting to affect my sleep. When I set an alarm to get up an exercise it takes an Olympic effort to get out of bed.
 It seems unfair that I can work for two weeks straight and lose two lbs, and stop for two days and gain it all back. The reason it seems unfair is because it is. You know what else it is? Reality. We have to find a way to deal with it.
 LOSING WEIGHT IS HARD BUT THESE MAKE IT EASIER
 STOP DRINKING YOUR CALORIES
 I started finding myself drinking the occasional coke, hot chocolate, etc. If you can stop drinking calories, you will be amazed at how that will boost your efforts.
 STAND INSTEAD OF SIT
 Standing desks have come down in price (they use to be around $1000 and now some are under $100 with electric desks coming in around $300).
 According to Jillian Michaels standing burns 1.5 the number of calories. If sitting burns sixty calories, standing burns ninety. 
 AVOID CHEAT DAYS
 The idea is to have a sustainable life. We try to be good Monday through Friday and then on the weekend we indulge and when we do WE GO ALL IN and erase all the work we did during the week. 
 BUT ITS SO HARD TO BE GOOD 100% of the TIME
 If we can be good 80% of the time we will make progress. You want a hamburger? Fine. Have a hamburger but skip the fries and the coke. You can have both. 
 You want 80% of the calories you consume in a day to be better view calories. The Noom app does this. There are green foods (eat as much as you like), Yellow Foods (Be cautious), and Red Foods (WARNING!). You want to avoid the Red foods, and keep the yellow food in check. You are looking for balance. 
 By using the 80/20 rule you are not depriving yourself 100%. Sure there will be things you have to postpone, but the ability to enjoy one item can take some of the dread of dieting, and the same of dieting, and make you feel a bit normal.

   Weigh-in: I'm up 1.6 lb back to 225.3
 I skipped a workout (typically every other day) and said, ""I'll just end up doing two workouts back to back days."" In other words,"" I""ll do it tomorrow.""
 So I did and I'm here to tell you my body doesn't like it. In the long run this won't work. So this episode is for me to listen in the future to remind myself that as hard as it is getting on my exercise bike, getting off I always feel proud with a boost of momentum to start the day. 
 Building Self Discipline
 An article in Entrepreneur stated
 

  Know your weaknesses Remove temptations Set clear goals and have an execution plan Build your self-discipline Create new habits by keeping it simple Eat often and healthy Change your perception about willpower Give yourself a backup plan Reward yourself Forgive yourself and move forward  I didn't know ""captain obvious"" worked for Entrepreneur magazine. 
   I was reading an article and it had a great plan. 
 Track your feed for 10 days and look at those days where your weight maintains. Then take the average of those days and subtract 500 calories. 
 So if you had
 2100
 1900
 2200
 1950
 2300
 1876
 2400
 1911
 2145
 1978
 The average is 2076 
 Subtract 500 calories and you get 1576 calories per day.
 The key to this is to take the calories of the days you maintained. Guys don't want to go below 1500 calories and Women shouldn't go below 1200.
 ONE MEAL
 I had ""Christmas"" last weekend as my brother goes out of town and the meal put 2 lbs on me the next day. For me looking back, a strategy would've been to:
 Put the food away after the meal. 
 Get the cookies off the table 
 In general, out of sight out of mind. Especially if you keep telling yourself, ""OK, this is my last one..."" then you know you are having an issue. Get it out of sight. 
 
 Mentioned in this Episode
 What Is a Calorie Deficit, and How Much of One Is Healthy? 
 Healthy Wage 
 Noom App 
 Try the free CSS beautifier lets you easily beautify stylesheets for your websites. Weigh In First things, I'm down .3 lbs. Not a huge win, but not a loss.
  
 Currently, the Noom app is giving me Green, Yellow and Red foods.
  
 The Most Addictive Foods
 Interesting article on the most addictive foods (hint its not broccoli)
 Eat Yourself Sexy 
 I found an interesting show called Eat Yourself Sexy on Amazon Prime, and while the show has some ""meh"" reality TV isms, I liked that you can spot what OTHER PEOPLE are doing wrong. Watch an episode or two and then go into your kitchen and pretend you're on the show.
  
 I also thought it was interesting that in 8 weeks women were losing 2 dress sizes and those that exercised (in addition to changing their diet) lost 20 lbs in 8 weeks (amazing what a little focus can do).
 Rolling Your Muscles?
  
 I bought a Doeplex Muscle Roller Massage Stick and I'm not sure it really does anything. I tested by just rolling my right leg, and so far don't feel any large difference.

Every Monday, celebrity trainer and longevity evangelist Ted Ryce interviews the world's brightest and most thought-provoking leaders about fitness, nutrition, biohacking, fat loss, sleep, hormones, chronic disease, anti-aging, mindfulness, and countless other health topics. He breaks it down providing science-based information so you can clear up the confusion and finally lose weight, fight disease, and live a longer, healthier life. More at: http://www.legendarylifepodcast.com Modern society makes getting healthy harder than ever. People are busy trying to balance work, family and other responsibilities. As a result, their health goals are often put on hold. That said, being healthy does not have to be difficult. In this episode, our special guest Marcus Sidhu reveals 11 smart ways to get healthier with minimal effort. Listen now! Getting caught up in your own lies can devalue your sense of self-worth, distort your view of reality, and negatively affect your close relationships. In this Real Talk Friday episode, I talk about how to stop lying to yourself and become a better version of yourself that achieves more in life! Listen now! Most of us desire to leave our mark on the world. We have this urge to create an extraordinary life. Yet, while focusing on everyday life we tend to get lost, confused, and uncertain. In this interview, Ph.D. David Tian reveals powerful tools for creating an extraordinary life of meaning and fulfillment. This is the blueprint for taking your life to a level you once only dreamed of. Listen now! I think it’s safe to say 2020 is off to a tense start. We’re hearing anxious news out of the Middle East, North Korea, and elsewhere in the world. The U.S. stock market is dipping. Oil prices are rising. It’s stressful. We are living in the United States of Stress right now. And in this Real Talk Friday episode, I talk about how these events are affecting our health and life balance. Plus, I share strategies on how we can control our environment to live a better life despite the current events. Listen Motivation is a flimsy thing. It ebbs and flows, and often abandons us when we need it most. That’s why we need something better than motivation to help us achieve our biggest goals. We need something deeper, stronger and more reliable. In this special episode, Jeff Sanders shares powerful strategies on how to stay hungry on the path to success. Listen Now! In this episode, Ted answers the following listeners' questions: .Can you develop diabetes on a low carb diet? .What is the best bang for your buck exercises if you want to lose hip and thigh fat and tone? .What's carb cycling for fat loss and how do I do it? .How do I continue my fat loss journey when you have injuries and can not work out as effectively? .How do I eat myself to eat less than I'm eating now? .Is there such a thing as too much of a calorie deficit? And much more."

As a therapist, health coach, and EFT practitioner, Tim helps his clients get to the root cause of their stress, finally process their trauma, and overcome the ailments that have developed as a result of emotional clutter.

He and Nimai discuss how you can locate and relieve your own blockages, understand your real desires, and finally get out of a cycle of triggers. Tim also explains how your diet plays a pivotal role in what’s stored in your body and why the energy you broadcast is imperative to living a happy, healthy life. You’ll hear the strategies and techniques he applies to clients that help them overcome addiction, eliminate phobias, and finally live according to who they are -- in spite of their past. 
  
 “What you’re doing is eliminating those triggers, because the triggers are what’s going to hold you back. The past emotional experiences are going to create self-sabotage.”
 -Tim Coleman

The Flipping 50 Show,"The podcast for those approaching 50, 50 and over 50 who want to change the way we age. Fitness, wellness, and health research put into practical tips you can use today. You still got it girl! Do exercise and fasting even belong in the same sentence? I’ve got the inside scoop for you in this episode.

Is exercise fasted a faster way to weight loss or sabotaging you? Is there a better way to fast? Walking mistakes may be keeping you from your best results. Doctors often recommend walking as a best exercise. However, the blanket “walk” advice leaves a lot of information out. You’ve got less room for error after 50, especially if you’re in menopause. Lady, you’re an influence for everyone around you. Though there is an abundance of information out there about women’s hormone health and you know we cover it here, there’s less about men’s hormone health. So we’re diving into it in this episode. Can you imagine nearly losing it all? What do you think of when I ask that? Did you think of money or you think of health? Today's guest nearly lost her life before she found the real value in health. Are you starting over after 50? Whether you choose it or it chooses you, starting over can be the best thing that ever happened. This episode is all about unwelcome changes followed by an exciting ride still unfolding for guest Lisa Hoffman. Have you ever set a New Year’s Resolution? Or set a weight or a performance goal? If you’ve ever been inspired to or forced to (I taught a health studies course for years, so that is for my students) … and if you’ve ever wondered, why you didn’t follow through or why you quit… then this episode is for you. "

 The Momentous Minute with Tim Caron
 Today's Momentous Minute is with Tim Caron, the owner of Allegiate Gym and performance engineer at Momentous, the sports nutrition company on a mission to clean up the supplement industry.
 Today's question is around plant-based versus whey-based proteins and the big question is when should you use a plant-based protein versus a whey-based protein?
 Tim Caron:
 More people than you realize actually have an intolerance or an allergy towards whey protein.
 Whey is a very fast digesting protein, so when you're looking at something that quickly digests, you may potentially have some adverse reactions.
 Signs and symptoms including distended gut, some skin irritation, inflamed joints, potentially loose stools, excessive flatulence, acute nausea. These might be all indications that you're not tolerating your whey protein as well as you should.
 Now, we need to supplement something in terms of getting increased protein levels, so a plant-based protein, usually kind of a combination of rice, hemp, and pea from really high quality sources, organic, and things that actually blend to make a complete protein.
 Plant based protein might be a really good alternative that doesn't have as much digestive issues as a whey protein.

 Here's the truth, life balance (or work-life balance) is a myth.
 There's no such thing. But this is actually good when you understand how it works and how it actually makes your life better.
 This was something I discovered years ago and now I'm sharing this with you.

 The Momentous Minute with Tim Caron
 Today's Momentous Minute is with Tim Caron, the owner of Allegiate Gym and performance engineer at Momentous, the sports nutrition company on a mission to clean up the supplement industry.
 Today's question is can you explain the different whey sources on the market? For example, isolate, concentrate, hydrolysate, can you explain what they mean and how they're different?
 Tim Caron:
 Isolate is a whey protein extracting out all the fat and just leaving the form of protein in terms of whey.
 Hydrolysate is basically an isolate that goes through a heating process, breaks down the peptides in to more individual amino acids and removes excess amounts of casein and sugar, specifically lactose.
 In the case of whey, they bio-availability and the rapid absorption is really, really important, which makes a big difference in terms of post-workout amino acid pool.
 We want to have one that's a little more broken down.
 The caveat to that is having an ability to digest whey and if it is really quick digesting and you have digestive issues, you're going to have a hard time with a very fast breaking down whey protein, like a hydrolysate.
 So, altering that potentially with a plant-based protein might be something you need to look into based off your ability to digest these really quick digesting proteins.

 The Momentous Minute with Tim Caron
 Today's Momentous Minute is with Tim Caron, the owner of Allegiate Gym and performance engineer at Momentous, the sports nutrition company on a mission to clean up the supplement industry.
 Today's question is how much protein can be consumed and utilized by the body at one time and what can alter protein consumption?
 Tim Caron:
 It depends a lot on your ability to digest proteins and your overall body mass.
 More muscle mass usually leads to more overall calories or individual macronutrients, in general, in specific to protein.
 So, when we take protein in abundance, this has a high satiety level and satiety means that we're going to get filled really fast.
 It's really difficult to determine an exact amount, but typically the bigger you are and the better you digest proteins, the more you can do that, which leads to the quality of the protein.
 You don't need as much when you have a higher quality of protein relative to eating a lower quality of protein mixed with some other things that might affect your actual satiety levels - like high sugar, maybe really processed foods, savory, salty foods.
 Getting higher quality protein, in conjunction with higher quality foods, helps your ability to digest and assimilate proteins at a higher level.

 You'll learn about the 4 stages of overcoming injuries and the key things I've learned and experienced through decades of training.
 This simple framework is important to understand to get back to full training, as quickly as possible.

 The Momentous Minute with Tim Caron
 Today's Momentous Minute is with Tim Caron, the owner of Allegiate Gym and performance engineer at Momentous, the sports nutrition company on a mission to clean up the supplement industry.
 Today's question is when does it make sense to use a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) product? What does the research say about this?
 Tim Caron:
 BCAA's, in regards to what's actually in them, is a combination of leucine, isoleucine, and valine.
 Reasons why we want to have those three individually is largely due to getting leucine in our body.
 Leucine's an amino acid that's used during training, but it also stimulates the protein synthesis pathways.
 Now, in terms of what research is saying, a lot of it's actually leaning towards more essential amino acids and having amino acids that your body's not capable of producing kind of covers a lot more bases.
 If we're looking at getting our leucine levels to stimulate one energy production during training, as well as protein synthesis, having a lot more coverage in terms of all the essential amino acids is definitely where research is leaning towards and showing more promise.
 BCAA's still hold weight and can still be effective, just more research is leaning towards using essential amino acids.

 The Momentous Minute with Tim Caron
 Today's Momentous Minute is with Tim Caron, the owner of Allegiate Gym and performance engineer at Momentous, the sports nutrition company on a mission to clean up the supplement industry.
 Now, we've talked about the NSF certification before and the question today is when it comes to supplements, when do we need to look at with this certification (the NSF certification)?
 Tim Caron:
 If you're an athlete you should always be conscientious of what you're putting in your body.
 If you're someone who's competing you should always have a high standard in what you put in your body.
 In general, if you're investing in supplements you should always have the highest possible standard of what you're putting in your body, that makes a huge difference.
 And, when you're really evaluating your process of training and nutrition and supplements opting for the highest quality caliber of things to do and having a third party (NSF is the most widely respected independent certification organization today) that that actually can comes in and help you make that decision.
 It makes that process just a little bit easier, as well as a little clearer, on what you need to do.

 The Momentous Minute with Tim Caron
 Today's Momentous Minute is with Tim Caron, the owner of Allegiate Gym and performance engineer at Momentous, the sports nutrition company on a mission to clean up the supplement industry.
 Tim, today's question is what's most important to look for in protein supplements and how do we sort through so many different options that are available today?
 Tim Caron:
 Ingredient list. Look at the back of the label and actually seeing what's in there. Can you pronounce the ingredients? Do they look familiar? Are these things that you feel like something that wouldn't be hazardous to your body?
 I think there's a lot of intuition that should be used when you're looking at any supplements. The quality of the ingredients matters and as we dissect each one of these proteins, they have to have these products that have a shelf life and also have some sort of ability to break down and taste good when you're mixing it.
 So, looking at the back of the label and making sure it's grass-fed, making sure it's organic, making sure you can enunciate each one of those names makes a big difference in terms of how your body's going to react to that.
 Looking at the nutrition label should be paramount in most people's process of evaluating everything. Make that your first and foremost priority and you should be okay.

One Year No Beer | Hack your healthy Lifestyle,"The OYNB podcast will inspire you to take, or support you through a 28, 90 or 365 day alcohol-free challenge. Transform your life by changing your relationship with alcohol. Kick start your healthy habits and reconnect with your true self. When it comes to raising children, you have to make your moments count, because your child will only be a child for so long. Parents know this, but many find it harder than they expected to get in the quality time that they and their children need. And worries about doing it wrong can lead some parents not to even try. 
 Today’s guest joins the podcast to talk about intentional parenting. Justin Batt is the founder of Daddy Saturday, an organization designed to help dads raise good kids to become great adults. Justin explains how Daddy Saturday got started – his wife was getting started establishing her own business, and Justin found himself in the position of being the primary parent on most Saturdays. He noticed that these Saturdays didn’t always result in the kind of time he wanted to spend with his children, despite good intentions, so he decided to make a change. 
 “It starts with you as the parent first, and you modeling for your kids what you want to see in them.”
 Justin started making plans to engage with his children in an intentional way. With a plan of action in place, not only did Saturdays go more smoothly, but Justin found that he was able to be really present with his children, not just physically, but emotionally as well. 
 It didn’t take long for Justin to discover that he was not the only father experiencing similar things, and he set out to find a way to use his own engagement with his children to help out other fathers as well. This is what led to Daddy Saturdays. 
 In today’s episode, Justin explains how he began helping other fathers develop plans for engaging with their children and how that intention helped relationships improve. He also discussed his research into the problem of fatherlessness, including how fathers can sometimes be present in the household but not emotionally available for their children, and how that affects children and families. He also discusses his own experiences with alcohol and giving it up. Listen in to learn more about Justin, Daddy Saturday, and intentional parenting.

 Daddy Saturday: https://daddysaturday.com/ 
info@daddysaturday.com Mark Williamson says that he came from a privileged background – not in the sense that he came from wealth, but in the sense that he came from a loving family and enjoyed a happy, carefree childhood. Initially, Mark saw himself pursuing a scientific path. He studied engineering and became interested in understanding how to fix things and how the world works. This interest led him to finish a degree in electronics and pursue a Ph.D. He also worked on developing WiFi technology.
 However, Mark realized that he fundamentally enjoyed making connections with other humans, and he just wasn’t getting the human contact that he wanted from science or academia. So he decided to pursue another path. He went into management consulting but found that this career didn’t make him happy either. He liked the people he worked with but didn’t enjoy the job itself. 
 “What I realized on that journey is that it’s not just the planet that’s broken, our culture is broken.”
 It was during this period of his life that Mark began to develop debilitating back pain. He would wake up in the morning unable to get out of bed. He stopped running and participating in sports activities. He was told that he had a degenerative spine disease and that he might be in a wheelchair by the time he reached his forties. During this time, his wife, who was training to be an osteopath, gave him a book introducing him to the idea that emotional stress might contribute to physical pain. This led Mark to quit the job and pursue a new path. 
 Although Mark was on the path that would lead to him becoming the co-founder and director of Action for Happiness, that didn’t happen right away. Mark went back to school and got an MBA, but he wanted to use his skills and knowledge to do something with a social purpose. So, he spent five years working on the problem of climate change with Carbon Trust first. 
 It was this work that made him realize that the problem wasn’t just the environment that was in trouble, it was the culture. So Mark set out to find a way to improve the culture, which was what led him to found Action for Happiness. In today’s interview, Mark talks about thinking of success in terms of happiness, not income, discovering the things that really matter in life, and helping others do the same. He also discusses his status as a recovering people pleaser and his decision to take a break from alcohol. Listen in to hear more about Mark and his work, as well as how you can get involved with Action for Happiness.

 Mark Williamson - Director of Action for Happiness
 Action for Happiness: https://www.actionforhappiness.org/ Graham Roberts is a coach who believes that everyone is capable of anything. He believes that to change behaviour, one just has to figure out what makes people tick, why they make the decisions that they make, and how to ignite their motivation so that they’re able to achieve their aspirations.
 In today’s conversation between Graham and One Year No Beer’s Jen Fairbairns, Graham talks about starting his own business and the difficult decisions that he has had to make. Graham says that beginning his own business took a lot of soul searching. At the time he was only a little over a year into being a father, and going out on his own was a leap of faith.
 “The real strength of humankind is the ability to be authentic with the conversation that’s going on inside.”
 Graham works with organizations to transform the way that they work, and with world-class athletes to help them understand what they’re capable of achieving and how to go about it. According to Graham, authenticity is the key ingredient to success, and more importantly, to happiness. He sees it as a privilege when the people he works with make the space for him to be there with them and listen to them. 
 Graham believes that it’s important to put yourself in a position to explore and challenge your perspectives on the world. Graham himself does this by participating in adventure racing. He describes a recent event that he took part in – Rat Race’s Race to the Wreck in Namibia. He talks about the difficulty of biking through sand, the panic attack that he had on the fourth day of the race, and what he learned from the experience.
 Graham also talks about the advice that he would give to people who are working to give up alcohol. He talks about the importance of being fair with yourself, breaking a large goal into smaller, more manageable chunks, and why it’s important for people to understand that they do have choices. Listen in to the episode to hear more of what Graham has to say about changing behaviour and living honestly and authentically.

 Ispire on Instagram What happens when you quit your job to spend more time running ultramarathons? Just ask Chase and Nikki Parnell. Together, they’ve made big lifestyle changes and turned their love of running into a family activity. 
 Previously, Chase worked as a lawyer in Bend, Oregon. He was always interested in distance running and got into running ultramarathons about 8 years ago. He describes running as his passion. However, while Chase was still working as a lawyer, he was also a big drinker. Between that and the stress and hours of his job, his efforts to scrape by eventually came crashing down. He decided it was time to make a life change. Chase had heard Andy interviewed on a podcast and was inspired by the dialogue, and that encouraged him to get into the OYNB community. Chase quit drinking, and he also quit his job. 
 Chase’s wife, Nikki, is also a runner. Chase got her interested in ultramarathons, and she’s found ways to not only get involved in running and in the ultramarathon community but also ways to include their children as well. Nikki says that they enjoy it and that it’s good for them to see their parents show up and say yes to something that’s difficult. 
 “It’s fun to discover what you can and can’t do.” – Chase Parnell
 Chase says that abstaining from alcohol has improved his training. Although Chase is relatively new to One Year No Beer, he says that just waking up without a mild hangover in the mornings is a big improvement. 
 In today’s interview, Chase and Nikki talk about their Treeline Journal, where they write about running, marathoning, and their family. They discuss managing their relationship now that they work together and run together, what their goals are, and how they fit into the ultramarathoning community. Listen in to hear more about what Chase and Nikki are doing and how giving up alcohol has made a difference in their lives.

 Treeline Journal:  https://treelinejournal.com/about-us-chase-parnell-nikki-parnell/ Which is better for health and weight loss, paleo or veganism? Is one diet really better than all the others? Or is weight loss more about mindset and what works for you as an individual, rather than about finding the one correct diet plan? And what is it that causes disordered eating or just a seeming inability to lose the weight that you want to lose in order to look and feel your best? Today’s interview will address some of those questions.
 Today’s guest is Adele Tevlin, who has devised a revolutionary weight loss program and created a coaching business to help business executives manage their weight for life. Her goal is to help bridge the gap between what people know and what they actually do. 
 “There’s always something in the background that’s holding us back from achieving our level of greatness.”
 Adele knew from an early age that she wanted a career that would allow her to help people. At one point, she was gearing up to follow in her mother’s footsteps and attend dental school, but she realized that wasn’t quite the way that she wanted to help people. So, Adele studied neuroscience in college. Additionally, she had a background as a ballet dancer, which meant that she spent time around women who had eating disorders. She was curious about why some people struggle with mental health issues while others are resilient to them, and she brought this curiosity into her life’s work.
 In today’s episode, Adele talks about actionable ideas that can help people eat better and lose weight, like planning ahead so that they don’t end up overeating or grabbing unhealthy food just because it’s fast and easy. She discusses the importance of identifying your own blind spots and finding healthy food options wherever you happen to be, as well as the importance of choosing a diet plan that works for your individual body and circumstances. 
 Adele also discusses why it can be so difficult to make needed changes, even when someone has a lot of pain that could be addressed by making those changes. She posits that for some people, the pain points still might just not be high enough, and explains how narratives or imprints that people have about themselves may affect how much effort they’re willing to put into losing weight and how successful they are, as well as how people can address those negative imprints. 
 Adele talks about how cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is action-oriented and focused on the present and the future, and why she finds CBT to be a useful tool in helping people address weight loss and other issues. She also discusses the idea that successes come with a cost, the lasting effects of trauma in childhood, and the benefits of mindfulness and meditation. Listen in to hear more details about Adele’s philosophy and work.

 Elevating Leadership: http://ceoblueprint.co/home Can changing your morning routine change your life? And what do you have to do to not only grow on a personal level, but also get out of your comfort zone, challenge yourself, and achieve your larger goals? Those are the things that you’re going to hear about from today’s guest Hal Elrod, author of The Miracle Morning and a new book, The Miracle Equation.
 Hal starts by talking about his first book, The Miracle Morning. However, as Hal explains, the idea for the Miracle Morning wasn’t really a book idea at all to begin with. The idea originated after the crash in the US economy in 2007. Hal says that his own life went into a spiral along with the economy. So, he began looking up habits and rituals of successful people. Much of the information he came across referenced morning routines, but Hal himself wasn’t much of a morning person. But he decided to give it a try. 
 “The miracle is always inevitable when you live by the miracle equation.”
 Hal came up with a list of six practices. At first, he was going to try only one, but then he decided to see what would happen if he tried all of them. He anticipated needing to put this change into practice for six to twelve months before seeing any results – but he saw dramatic changes in only two months. His wife dubbed the practice his “miracle morning” and the six practices became the acronym SAVERS: Silence (meditation), Affirmations, Visualization, Exercise, Reading, and Scribing (journaling). It took Hal three years to finish writing The Miracle Morning.
 Hal also talks about his newest book, The Miracle Equation. As he describes it, the concept of the miracle morning is the process for daily personal development, but that by itself is not enough to get a person out of their comfort zone so that they can achieve larger goals. The process for doing that is what Hal lays out in The Miracle Equation.
 Hal explains the rearview mirror effect – how people can come to believe that they can’t accomplish a thing because they look in their personal “rearview mirror” and see that they haven’t achieved that thing before. He also talks about the importance of having faith in yourself, the four steps to effective affirmations, and what to do when you’re stuck dwelling on something in the past that you can’t change. Listen to the interview to hear more about Hal and The Miracle Equation.

 It's all a part of the childhood journey and, as parents and coaches, it's our role to not only set up kids for their best performances, but also develop their longterm love of being active, and provide them opportunity to utilize the lessons that sport provides and apply them to all other areas of their life.

Garage Gym Athlete,"The Garage Gym Athlete Podcast was born from a community of underground athletes you've probably never heard of before. The idea for this show stemmed from Jerred Moon, the creator of Garage Gym Athlete programming, when he would do weekly coaching calls with Garage Gym Athletes. He found each athlete had such a unique story, an inspirational journey, and had overcome their own set of challenges that could help impact other athletes...but only if the stories could be told to all. The athletes all have a diverse background; some from Powerlifting, CrossFit, Olympic Lifting, Endurance Training, Military Operators, Collegiate Athletes, Spartan Racers, Obstacle Course Racers, and many other forms of physical training. It takes the experience of these athletes braving the extreme heat, bitter cold, early mornings, and late nights to tackle their training and become athletes. This podcast is for Garage Gym Athletes and by Garage Gym Athletes. Athletes share their experience (whether a beginner or advanced), share their knowledge, and give us a glimpse into the life of a Garage Gym Athlete!! We all know the gym SUCKS...And it comes with a long commute, crowds of people, occupied equipment, and much worse...Also, home fitness SUCKS...Because the treadmill becomes a clothing rack...Or you spend an hour with a DVD jumping around in your living room...But we're changing the game...By providing the other guy (who's strapped for time) with intelligent training to help them perform and look like an athlete. Our aim is for this podcast to inspire your own Garage Gym journey and to pick up as much as you can from other Garage Gym Athletes who are crushing it!! This weeks Ask Me Anything is about intermittent fasting. Some of us coaches and a lot our athletes already do IF, but we always get new athletes in wondering more about IF and how best to do it with their schedule, goals, etc.  Hey all, this weeks study we are talking about becoming more powerful. The study we go over looked at the effects of velocity metrics, lifting faster and how it can increase performance. Next we have our first book review! We do a deep nutrition dive, about Deep Nutrition, by Dr. Catherine Shanahan. This weeks workout is 1/4 mile for humanity.  This weeks snippet is why our training is not crossfit and should not be considered crossfit.  This weeks athlete of the week is Greg Isenhour. Greg has been up the podcast before and is still crushing it, doing crazy events and still living his best life. We talk about keeping up with events, him doing the Baton Death march again, and recovery.  This weeks Ask Me Anything are are talking about having goals that may seem conflicting and talking about how to pursue goals that may seem conflicting. A lot of people think you can only do on thing at a time and only focus on one area but that is not sure, that is why we do whats called concurrent training. But Jerred dives more into this topic and the science behind it. Hey athletes, this week for our study we are slightly stray away from the actual study but for good reason. We will be talking about gaining muscle even when in a caloric deficit and what you really need to build muscle. Also why the ""if it fits my macros"" approach doesnt really work. This weeks topic we share our tips and practices on downregulation. This weeks workout is Sallys Revents. "

Just Fly Performance Podcast,"The Just Fly Performance Podcast is dedicated to all aspects of athletic performance training, with an emphasis on speed and power development. Featured on the show are coaches and experts in the spectrum of sport performance, ranging from strength and conditioning, to track and field, to sport psychology. Hosted by Joel Smith, the Just Fly Performance Podcast brings you some of the best information on modern athletic performance available. Today’s episode is a question and answer session where I take a break from the typical interview format and reflect on listener questions.  I always enjoy doing these shows, since it’s great to get a pulse on what training topics are on the mind of the coaching community. 



For this show, the particular focus was questions on sprinting and sprint training, as well as a lot of ideas on jumping in conjunction with foot strength.  We also touched on a lot of physical preparation principles, such as correction of asymmetry and how I’ve changed my philosophy in working with team sport athletes over time.



Today’s episode is brought to you by SimpliFaster, supplier of high-end athletic development tools, such as the Freelap timing system, kBox, Sprint 1080, and more.



More show notes at just-fly-sports.com/podcast-186-joel-smith/ Today’s episode features András Hegyi, a final-stage Ph.D. student working at the Neuromuscular Research Center at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland.  His Ph.D. work focuses on regional and inter-muscular hamstrings EMG activity in different hamstring exercises and in running.  Hegyi is interested in improving biomechanical methodologies to assess hamstrings to further understand hamstring muscle function and injury mechanisms.



We’ve done some great episodes on hamstring injury prevention in the past, such as episode 161 with Jake Schuster and 158 with JB Morin.  This show is another fantastic addition to that series as András is a wealth of knowledge on the topic, being well versed on what the research yields in regards to many aspects of training and hamstring development, as well as what is functionally asked of the hamstrings in sprinting and sport.



When it comes to hamstrings and injury prevention, a common question is: “What exercises should I do in the gym to help this process”?  An important aspect of the gym and sprinting is that the way these elements “hit the hamstrings” is quite different.  It is important to know what we can, and can’t do in the weightroom to create robust athletes. 



In this episode, András goes into hamstring strain mechanisms, Nordic hamstrings and variations, different gym exercises that hit different aspects of the hamstring musculature, sprinting and it’s role in injury prevention.  He also shares his thoughts on training the adductor magnus as a synergist of the hamstring.  Another important point covered is the importance of individual muscle activation differences in sprinting versus what we see in the gym, which has big implications on how we are training and assessing athletes.



Today’s episode is brought to you by SimpliFaster, supplier of high-end athletic development tools, such as the Freelap timing system, kBox, Sprint 1080, and more.

Mike Kozak is the Owner of SOAR Fitness in Columbus, Ohio.  He has trained hundreds of youth athletes as well as a number of current and prospective college and pro athletes. Mike has previously worked as a physical education teacher and youth basketball coach.  He frequently hosts “Rewire” clinics with Adarian Barr and is a fervent student of biomechanics and cutting edge sports performance techniques. He has written several articles for Just Fly Sports.



Stephen Laflamme attained his clinical Doctorate of Physical Therapy from The Ohio State University in 2016 and graduated from the University of Maine in 2012 with a Bachelor's Degree in Exercise Science; also attaining his Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist Certification.  Stephen competed twice in the Arnold Weightlifting Championships and qualified for the 2015 National University Championship in weightlifting. Stephen has traveled the country to be a part of the nation's best educational programs and learn from the nation's best professionals.



When it comes to things like bilateral and single leg squatting, everyone tends to have their own favorite variations, but how often do we think about exactly why we are performing a front, Zercher or RFE split squat?  Are we prescribing these exercises based on what other coaches are utilizing, or based on the individual characteristics and needs of our athletes? In today’s episode Mike and Stephen get into both general and specific principles in catering to athletes optimally in these basic strength movements. 



We had a great recent episode with Justin Moore in episode 176 talking about “knees in” from a holistic perspective, getting into the hydraulics of the body and the pelvic floor.  In this episode we continue in that vein, and get particularly into this dynamic in squatting, landing and jumping, and the differences that exist here, as well as practical training ramifications.  Finally, Mike and Stephen talk about training the foot, as well as integrating some concepts learned from Adarian Barr.

More show notes at just-fly-sports.com/podcast184-kozak-and-laflamme/ Today’s episode features Dr. Nick Serio.  Nick received his doctorate of education in sport and performance psychology from the University of Western States.  He is the co-owner and general manager of the “Athlete’s Warehouse” located in Pleasantville, New York. Nick also serves as the head pitching coach at Fox Lane high school, where the baseball team has had tremendous success.  



I watched Nick’s presentation on medicine ball training he did at the NISMAT symposium, which was a phenomenal and creative demonstration of special strength training for pitchers.  Nick’s work is the epitome of the full-spectrum blend of knowledge of sport specific skill needs, appropriate special strength exercises, as well as solid general strength principles.   



Nick’s special strength medicine ball programming is facilitating significant increases in players throwing speeds, all while keeping their arms healthy, as they avoid throwing baseballs year round (a huge factor in getting injured or burning out early).  Despite the impressive results he gets, Nick is a very honest and transparent individual, as he also indicates the many other training modalities the players are doing (plyometrics, resistance training) as well as simply growing and maturing. Regardless, Nick’s creative solutions to training are something special to learn about, and have ramifications for all throwing athletes, and rotational sports.



On the show today, Nick goes into the factors contributing to the massive injury increases in baseball, and how his medicine ball program can help combat this.  He also chats about general principles in training throwers, postural issues, and then gets into the fine points of his medicine ball training program. Nick also addresses the action of the front block leg in throwing, which is a universal principle, applicable to a great variety of rotational sports. 



Today’s episode is brought to you by SimpliFaster.com, supplier of high-end athletic development tools, such as the Freelap timing system, kBox, Sprint 1080, and more.  Today’s episode features John Garrish, director of athletic development &amp; performance at North Broward Preparatory School in Coconut Creek, Florida, and the school’s head track and field coach.  John has previously served as the Director of Athletic Performance with the Florida Rugby Union’s High-Performance Program 7’s team, and has been involved in numerous other strength and sport coaching roles. He also serves as the National High School Strength Coaches Association Regional Board Member for the Southeast.



John is a passionate, creative and detail oriented coach, who distributes his methods freely through his social media outlets.  At North Broward prep, John has the challenges of teaching speed and athletic movement to large groups of athletes at a time.  In doing so, he has implemented a variety of unique mini-hurdle variations with arm position, as well as hand and finger positioning, these each having unique impacts on the athletes.  John is a tremendous compiler of data and sprint images, and it was a joy to pick his brain on his speed training implementation and discoveries.



On the show today, John covers his management of the weight room as North Broward and how he manages large groups of athletes with a small support staff.  He describes his use of gallops and various skips as an important part of his warm-up process, and then gets into all of the mini-hurdle speed constraints in his program, which is a true highlight.   This was a fantastic episode on speed training for not just the high school athlete, but any athlete seeking improved speed and explosive ability.

View more show notes at just-fly-sports.com/podcast-182-john-garrish/ Today’s episode features Tyler Yearby and Michael Zweifel.



Tyler Yearby is a Former Strength &amp; Conditioning Coach at Northeastern State University and the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities who has delivered over 200 domestic &amp; international continuing education courses, workshops, and conference presentations in 12 countries.  Tyler has, and continues to work with athletes ranging from youth to professional.  Michael Zweifel is the owner and head of sports performance for “Building Better Athletes” performance center in Dubuque, Iowa.  Michael has been on a number of previous Just Fly Performance Podcast episodes, focusing largely on the development of reactive agility and transferable sport movement.  Tyler and Michael are both a part of “Emergence” which is a movement skill education company.



When it comes to building athletes in the agility and change of direction space, attitudes are changing and coaches are realizing how important it is to teach perception and decision making in a variety of situations, to eventually transfer better to sport.  Agility done for the sake of running through cones as fast as possible is very limited in what it can do for an athlete in a chaotic sport environment, and podcast #76 was the epitome of that information.



Today’s show takes those same ideas of reactivity and creative movement, and puts it into the structure of the weight room: resistance training and plyometric exercises.  Tyler and Michael try to mirror their approach to an “athlete based” model of problem solving throughout an entire program, and in this episode they share how creative means are utilized in the weight room to not only improve movement and robustness, but also stoke the fires of athlete creativity.  On the show today, we dig into what these sequences look like, and get to the core of “athlete centered” training in the weight room on the level of variability, and much more.

Master Your Health Podcast,"The Master Your Health Podcast is all about providing you with the information and tools you need to elevate your life.  The hosts, Chris Rocchio and Amanda Rocchio, are dedicated to being your top resource for all things health, nutrition, fitness and wellness. While we believe there is no one-size-fits-all plan that is perfect for everyone, we’re all about discovering the right systems that work for you to accomplish your health and wellness goals. What’s sleep got to do with it? Everything! Getting a good night of quality sleep can make all the difference in your day. Similar to how a morning routine can help set you up for success, prioritizing your sleep with a nighttime routine is just as important. In this episode we break down everything from the effects of inadequate sleep, to the benefits of REM sleep, and even tips to help you achieve it. Curious how posture affects your life? Ever wonder if there were steps you could take to cultivate better mindfulness throughout your day? Cue Aaron Alexander, a pioneering manual therapist and movement coach with over sixteen years of professional experience. In this episode, we discuss a wide range of topics from the importance of moving your body and being aware of your posture, to the effects of body language, to self-care. Having a morning routine is a great way to start the day and set yourself up for success. In this episode, we discuss some of the many benefits of having a productive morning routine. We also dive into what our morning routines look like almost every day and share some other successful people’s morning routine. People have been sitting in hot tents and rooms since ancient times. This practice of sitting in hot rooms was often thought of as a spiritual purification and to be healing and cleansing on the body. In today’s podcast, we explore all the studied benefits of sauna usage and why this ancient technique has continued to be such a staple in many people’s lives including Finland culture in particular.  Tyler is an aspiring Naturopathic Doctor, who attends the National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM) in Portland, Oregon. In this episode, we break down all things detoxification and discuss why it’s so important to detox your body in a safe way. Tyler really brings nuance to the conversation around detoxification, dispels myths and informs you how to support your body with the detoxification process the natural way.  While we often promote HIIT training and strength training, we forget about the great benefits of simply just going for a walk. This episode is a powerful reminder of how beneficial adding in some extra steps to your day can be. We also share some ideas for how to incorporate walking into your daily routine."

One foot in front of the other. One rep more. One intentional meal. These small things may not seem like much in the moment they compound into monumental changes in our healthy behaviors. But how can we realistically measure progress along the way? How can we know what success looks and feels like? It is not always the number on the scale or the weight on the barbell, and that is what strength and conditioning expert Josh Cuthbert drives home to his clients whether they are stay-at-home parents, CEO's, or professional athletes.

   What happens when you are in a relationship and your ritual of going to the gym doesn't make sense to the other person? How can we effectively communicate to our significant other what is important to us and why? Compromise in relationships are a must, but should you have to sacrifice your own health and fitness just because it is not as important to the other person? All these questions and more we explore in the January 2020 relationship health episode.

We all can agree that, when it comes to improving our health and fitness we have to put in the reps. Usually that means in the gym. But... what about our spiritual health? How can we go deeper on the parts of our progress in the gym and in life that we can't quite put a finger on as to why things are working so well (or not)? Sal Di Stefano and Adam Schafer of Mind Pump and Josiah Novak of True Transformation and I begin discussing what we believe it means to be authentic and our interpretation of masculinity but quickly find ourselves talking about religion, spirituality and even the ""woo"".

Physical Preparation Podcast – Robertson Training Systems,"The Physical Preparation Podcast is designed to help trainers, coaches and athletes take their performance to the next level. Featuring some of the brightest minds in our industry, we'll dive in to deconstruct smart training, and help you or your athletes maximize results! Ever since he was a child, Radley Haddad has been passionate about baseball. 



Born and raised in Indiana, Radley started playing when he was six years old with his friends in their backyard. He played travel ball in high school and soon started his baseball career at West Carolina University, where he played for two years before transferring to Butler University. 



And eventually, after a ton of hard work, Radley got an opportunity to play in the Minor Leagues with the New York Yankees and, after his fourth season, became the team’s Major League Coaching Assistant &amp; Bullpen Catcher.



Radley joins me today to share his experiences with the New York Yankees. He illustrates his daily routines and responsibilities as a coach and bullpen catcher and the challenges he faced while transitioning from playing the game to coaching athletes. 



Radley defines what advanced scouting is and how it helps the team win. He differentiates the two types of evaluation and highlights their importance. And finally, he reveals why athletes should be their own best coach and the impact of self-evaluation.







“Once you figure out what makes you successful, that’s when you can take off as a coach or player. Being your own best coach depends on being a good self-evaluator.” - Radley Haddad

Thanks for tuning into this week’s episode of The Physi... An athlete’s triumph lies in more than just training inside the gym or following a routine.



After all, while many coaches take their clients and athletes follow specific training programs, not all of them achieve success on the field.



In that case, what separates good athletes from great ones?



What are the key factors that drive an athlete’s growth and development?



And how can coaches use those factors to ensure their athletes’ success?



In today’s episode, I share the four key ingredients necessary for ensuring your clients and athletes achieve success in and out of the gym. I explain how humility and communication skills can create the right training environment for athletes.



I illustrate how commitment to the process can lead an athlete toward success. And I also share my experiences of training with NBA professionals such as Roy Hibbert, Glenn Robinson, and Kelan Martin to illustrate how they achieved success in their careers.

 

Great coaches not only have vision. They also have the unique ability to instill that vision into their clients and athletes. - Mike Robertson

 

This week on the Physical Preparation Podcast:

•	How the right training environment can affect an athlete’s growth

•	How a competitive training environment like Westside Barbell can foster progress towards success

•	The keys to building the right training environment for athletes

•	The importance of honesty, humility, and communication skills when training athletes

•	How having a vision helped NBA player Roy Hibbert get better results

•	Why coaches need to help athletes address and work through their weaknesses

•	How committing to the process of improvement helped Glenn Robinson and Kelan Martin achieve success

•	The power of committing to the process instead of the outcome

•	The psychological impact of belief in success

•	How coaches can instill their belief and vision into their clients

Cut Through Nutrition,"Have you ever wanted to know more about nutrition but felt overwhelmed by the amount of conflicting information on the internet? You're not alone.Join NHS surgeon Dr Joshua Wolrich and lawyer-turned-current nutrition PhD Alan Flanagan as they aim to cut through the state of nutritional discourse whilst encouraging collaboration between different healthcare professionals. Whether you're a layperson that wants to understand if celery juice can actually cure your eczema (spoiler; it can't) or a GP who wants to know what the current research is about low-carb diets for diabetes, this podcast is for you. It wouldn't have been right to conclude Season 1 without having dedicated an entire episode on the impact that socio-economics has on nutrition and health. It's a huge barrier to people both receiving and implementing any well-meaning advice that may be given, and one that needs to be acknowledged.

Thank you for joining us for our first season of the Cut Through Nutrition podcast! We hope this may be a solid base to come back to as we move forward. Talking about the pitfalls and the problems with nutritional discourse can often make it feel like nutritional science doesn't know anything. Fortunately, that's just simply not true.

In this episode, we discuss the current evidence around what actually constitutes a healthy diet, and what evidence-based simple advice might look like. Join us for the TL;DR of all nutritional science. No pressure Alan.

Relevant references can be found in the full show notes.

We also discuss how to identify common nutritional fallacies, including the appeal to authority, appeal to nature, appeal to ignorance, exception fallacy and the single cause fallacy.

If we’re going to make a podcast with the intention of addressing the current state of nutritional discourse, there's nothing more appropriate to start with than the phrase, 'Food is Medicine’.

In this first episode of season 1, we discuss how the phrase came to be; why it's become so trendy; and whether it's helpful or harmful to furthering the public perception of nutritional science*.

Tune in again next week as we unpack some of the important differences between biomedical and nutrition science which will help further explain why this phrase is misguided.

Anne and Mark break down their experience with injured athletes and Mike talks more than he should.  Our masters female athletes have unique physiology, and we have to start treating them that way. In this podcast, Mike and Mark interview Anne Linton, a physician, trainer, and masters athlete herself. No one is more poised to answer the tough questions regarding training masters female athletes. It may sound crazy to say we can reverse again, but it looks like someone has finally proven that it's possible…….kind of.  HERE is the really interesting study we're talking about.  To be fair, it’s a very small study, and it’s specifically of the Thymus gland.  So, it has to be taken with a grain of salt. Hey, what are you wearing?  OK, that was weird, but we do want to talk about wearable devices.

You may have noticed the 1 billion wearables and self-quantification devices on the market.  Well, we tried out every.....single......one.

OK, that's not true.  We have tried out quite a few, though, and we want to share out thoughts.

Enjoy! Pulsed electromagnetic field is a fascinating technology that seems to have a myriad of effects on the body.  It can be looked at like “cellular exercise” or a “mechanical adaptogen” as it helps the body heal and just perform better.  In this podcast episode we sit down with an expert in the field with over 20 years of experience and pick his brain. Autism is a really difficult disease.  We all know that it's on the rise.  It's also difficult in that a lot of the medications approved for autism have some pretty nasty side effects.  So, in this short podcast we talk about a nutritional tool that families can use with very little side effects.  Let food be thy medicine!"

"The Performance Podcast | Strength Training, Olympic Weightlifting, Performance, Fitness, Speed  | Wil Fleming and Coach Dos","The Performance Podcast is a weekly one-of-a-kind Strength, Conditioning, Training, Fitness, and Performance Podcast hosted by Wil Fleming and Coach Dos! Each week we have interviews with some of the top strength and conditioning coaches in the country as well as a 1 on 1 talk with legendary strength coach Robert Dos Remedios (Coach Dos) On today's episode we have Anthony Renna, author of Be Like the Best: A Guide to Reaching the Top in the Fitness Profession. 

Anthony is the host of the Strength Coach Podcast and co-owner of Strengthcoach.com. In this episode he shares the process of writing this monumental book and the things he has learned from interviewing the best coaches in strength and conditioning. 

Learn more and buy the book at www.belikethebest.com On this episode I interview collegiate track and field coach, 14x nationals pole vault qualifier Jeff Coover (also one of my best friends) about...

How to sprint faster.
Why the only way to run faster is to run fast.
What transfers from the weightroom to the track.

This is a great episode, check it out! In the coach Dos segment we talk about the fallacy of a big 3 and particularly only using those movements to train your athletes. This is a good one!

This week I interview Jimmy Duke of Lift For Life Weightlifting, a non-profit program for at risk youths in St. Louis. Jimmy is the coach of multiple international team members and an incredible coach. He fills us in on how he structures training for the youth athletes he trains. On this special podcast I go it alone and answer listener questions:

Should you program for yourself? 

Why you must be doing the jerk.

An easy way to use VBT

and a rant on my biggest pet peeves.  On this episode I talk with hall of fame guest, Mike McKenna. We talk about how to peak for a meet, how to be prepared for anything during a meet, and how to do a transition phase after a meet. 

With Coach Dos, I ask him about training in multiple planes and why so many programs forget to do it. On this episode I interview Tom Morris from Indiana University. Tom was one of my collegiate strength coaches, and 7 years ago he was in a catastrophic bike accident. 

He tells us how he overcame that tremendous adversity to now lead the strength department of a Power 5 school. 

In the Coach Dos segment we talk about, lifting on game day, designing conditioning programming for team sports and more. "

The Devan Kline Show,"If you are ready to stop starting over on your fitness journey, ready to amplify your results and ready to see lasting change, you are in the right place. My name is Devan Kline, CEO of Burn Boot Camp, and I’m here to coach you on taking your health and fitness to the next level.  Every Tuesday I bring you my best advice and practical strategies for igniting your transformation. Every Thursday I chat with the top influencers in the industry on the latest in nutrition, health and fitness.I traveled the country in my early 20's playing for the San Francisco Giants staying with host families in dozens of cities. I discovered that ""normal"" American problems were not the same as I had faced growing up but lethargy and lack of vitality led them to a similar unhappiness. It was so fulfilling to positively  impact their lives with my presence!After being released from the Giants at 24 y/o, Morgan (my wife) and I started Burn Boot Camp in a parking lot with our last $600. In the first 6 years, we've generated $100M in revenue and impacted almost 1 million families with hard work, belief, and a relentless drive! My podcast covers my physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual philosophy to help you take your life to the next level. It's my life's mission to help you create LASTING change, to ""stop starting over"", and to maximize your health and happiness!I'm always accessible to you on Instagram, DM me anytime! @devan.kline Being selfish is viewed as taboo, but how can you create happiness for others if you're not happy with yourself?  Putting equal emphasis on spiritual, mental, and fitness is a key piece of achieving happiness. Many people put it on the backburner when comes to loving and nurturing themselves, and it negatively impacts your life. Being selfish is necessary to life, energy, and vitality for your entire family.  Your past is part of who you are, but it doesn't need to define your entire life. Many of us have been conditioned by our past to be confined to a certain preconceived idea of what our lives will look like ahead of us. Our past does not dictate our future.  Listen in to these mental mastery tips to succeed in any and all areas of your life. 🔥 Today we're diving into my creative process! The ability to create is the ultimate power. When you can create, you have the power to design the life you desire. Take the thoughts in your mind and giving them a freshen up. It all starts with one word, and one word only: focus. Grab a pen and join me in this episode! Focus is arguably the most powerful tool you have. You can take your life to an entirely new level by changing your mentality!  When you look for reasons to succeed, you're going to find them. The same applies when you look for reasons to fail - you find what you're looking for! Using a simple thought process to shift your mood can drastically change your life.  It can sound obvious, but when you really think about the core functions of each, they are completely different and sometimes don't understand each other sometimes. It's important to understand the true purpose of these three- they drive 100% of your emotions, thoughts, and in turn your actions!  My least favorite word is ""plateau."" I like to call is slowed-progression. Just because your progress may not be as fast as before, doesn't mean you're failing. In those moments, it's time to dig in and pivot to a new strategy. "

Babbittville Radio – Babbittville,"Since 1990, Bob Babbitt, a USA Triathlon and Ironman Hall of Fame inductee, has been hosting a highly-acclaimed radio program and podcast showcasing the world’s best runners, triathletes, and cyclists - first with The Competitors and now with his new show, Babbittville Radio. These are long-form interviews, and over the years, endurance athletes have enjoyed downloading and listening to insightful and entertaining conversations with legendary athletes like cyclist Greg LeMond, triathlete Paula Newby-Fraser, or runner Meb Keflezighi while they are out running, cycling, swimming, or working out in the gym.Babbitt has always been a big believer in the life-lessons we all learn through endurance sports and, besides interviewing endurance sports legends, there are  also interviews with incredibly motivational and inspirational athletes along with a diversified mix of conversations with the best coaches, race directors, journalists, sports scientists, and authors. James Sa’s life changed forever on July 31, 2011 when he became a quadriplegic after being injured during an obstacle course race in Michigan. Watching the movie ‘Murder Ball’ while in rehab helped James find the sport of Quad Rugby that is now a huge part of his life.



 



  Besides being a true running legend with an Olympic silver medal, a New York City Marathon win, a Boston Marathon win, and four appearances in the Olympic Games, Meb Keflezighi is part of the ownership group for the world's fastest road 5K, the infamous Carlsbad 5000, presented by National University. This year the Junior Carlsbad is on Saturday March 21st and the Carlsbad 5000 is on Sunday March 22nd. For all of the details check out carlsbad5000.com.



  Patrick Lange is the two-time Ironman World Champion and the course record holder for the marathon. This past October he pulled out of the race during the bike ride with a virus. We chatted about his career, dealing with the disappointment of having to pull out of Kona, and his goal to win again in 2020.



 



  Katie Zaferes was invited out to the Olympic Training Center in Colorado after finishing her collegiate running career at Syracuse. Her first day there was January 14, 2013. In a very short period of time she went from not being able to click into her pedals to becoming a 2016 Olympic Triathlete. After winning four of eight WTS races in 2019 plus the Grand Final, Katie finished the year ranked number one in the world. She is also the defending Super League Champion!



  Jim Knaub is a wheelchair racing legend with five Boston Marathon wins and three at the LA Marathon. He was an Olympic Trials pole vaulter on his way to a workout on his motorcycle when a car turned into him and his life was changed forever. His motto? Why walk when you can fly!



 



  Milena Glusac was running 25 miles a week in high school and dominating. When she went to college, her coaches doubled her running mileage and she ended up with Epstein Barr Syndrome, chronic fatigue, an eating disorder, and multiple stress fractures. After leaving college and connecting with great coaches who kept her mileage low and created training programs specifically for her, she ended up winning US National Championships at the 20K and the half marathon.

The TriDot Podcast,"This is The TriDot Podcast! TriDot uses your training data and genetic profile combined with predictive analytics and artificial intelligence to optimize your training. Giving you better results, in less time, with fewer injuries. Our podcast is here to educate, inspire,and entertain. We’ll talk all things triathlon with expert coaches and special guests. Join the conversation, and let's improve together. Knowing how many watts you're producing on the bike gives you both insight and control during your training and racing. And with power meters and smart trainers becoming more and more affordable, training with power is more practical than ever. The ability to train with power is undoubtedly one of the most beneficial training investments you can make. In this episode, we discuss the intricacies of training with power meters and smart trainers and the tips and tricks to get the most benefit from using power in your bike training. Data and analytics have become an integral part of triathlon training. Yet, most triathletes don't recognize the true power of their data or realize the incredible results they make possible. In this episode, we cover analytics for triathletes in a way that is highly insightful for both novices and techies. We separate the meaningful from the clutter. We overview advanced analytics technologies such as data mining, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning and discuss how these technologies are changing the way we train and race triathlons. Nutrition is often referred to as triathlon's fourth discipline. There is undeniable value in properly fueling your body for training, racing, and a healthy lifestyle. Join us in this episode as sports nutritionist, Dr. Krista Austin, digs into performance nutrition and how to establish and maintain proper macro and micro nutrient intake relative to your resting metabolic rate and energy expenditure. She also offers clutch strategies for properly fueling and hydrating for optimal training, racing, and recovery. Since its origin in 2011, The Preseason Project has been a powerful triathlon training research environment and a catalyst for continuous improvement and innovation. The participating athletes themselves have made this possible.  Training data and direct feedback from more than 15,000 triathletes has driven significant measurable improvements over industry norms in training efficiency, race results, and overall athlete experience.  This has fundamentally changed how athletes train and how coaches coach.  Today we look back on the history of the Preseason Project and the milestone findings, results, and events that have defined its continuing influence on triathlon industry. Whether you're training for a local sprint or a full IRONMAN, training at the right intensity levels in your run sessions will pay off big time! But how do you know when to run 'hard', when to run 'easy', what exactly is 'hard' or 'easy', how long to hold different intensities, and when it's better to use heartrate or pace? In this episode, we'll drill down on these and other topics with run experts Jeff Raines and Elizabeth James. Assessments are about much more than just benchmarking your progress. Learn mental strategies to embrace the challenge of the week and practical tips for getting the most out of each session, We'll reveal many hidden benefits of your assessments, if performed correctly, and how they are used to optimize your training and increase your performance."

Jason Phillips, Owner of The Nutritional Coaching Institute, IN3 Nutrition, and the Impact Collective, is one of the most successful coaches in the game. Jason discovered the power of nutritional coaching as a young man when he recovered from anorexia and learned that the proper application of food can save lives. 
 He was the first one to educate the CrossFit community on the importance of post-workout supplements, and he’s since gone on to work with UFC fighters, WWE wrestlers, and fitness celebrities.
 These experiences have taught Jason that you don’t need a “nutrition philosophy”—all you need is a tool chest of smart nutrition coaching techniques and a system to determine what you need right now. Find out what that system and techniques are right now.

The Art Of Living with Kathy Smith,"Health news that you can use with New York Times Best-Selling Author and Fitness Titan, Kathy Smith. Listen up if you want the most up-to-date and accurate information on fitness, longevity, health, aging and motivation. Each show consists of the biggest stories in health as well as new breakthrough techniques to live a healthier, more vibrant life. You'll feel like you're part of the conversation as Kathy gets real on The Art of Aging! If you knew there was a technique where you could achieve just about anything you want by learning how to focus on your strengths and what you’re good at - instead of trying to correct your weaknesses - would you want to learn that technique? I sure would! That’s why I’m so delighted to have Fatima Doman the author of Authentic Strengths on the show today. 
 
 Fatima is one of the most influential voices in positive change...in other words, how to focus on what’s going strong instead of what’s going wrong your life. She's a Bestselling Author, Speaker, and Executive Coach, and has motivated audiences across six continents to leverage their authentic strengths for personal  transformation. Today, we’re going to talk about her incredible system that will help you achieve your goals and stay motivated… especially when life gets busy, chaotic, and you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed.
 For more information, visit www.kathysmith.com/podcast. Chances are good that you, or someone you know, is dealing with anxiety. One in five Americans over 18, and one in three teenagers 13 to 18, reported having a chronic anxiety disorder during the past year.  
 Now, everyone worries sometimes. But if you’re repeatedly feeling panicky, or anxious, or find yourself avoiding situations because of irrational fears, then you’re going to want to listen to today’s podcast.
 I believe everything happens for a reason, and it was no coincidence that when I was shopping for an outfit for burning man, I met today’s guest, Julian Brass. Little did I know that chance meeting would lead to today’s podcast about a subject that I’m passionate about. 
 His international best-selling book, Own Your Anxiety, takes you on an inspirational journey of self-discovery, to transform anxiety into your secret edge. With 99 bite-sized, powerful tips in the book, you may discover that anxiety is your greatest  gift. 
 For more information, visit www.kathysmith.com/podcast. Throughout the years, we hear about the latest innovations in fitness that claim to change the way we’re going to workout forever. Although most of these trends don’t really catch on, there is always one that manages to break through and get identified as a game changer. Well, the buzz right now is about “blood flow restriction training.” It is one of the newest training tools to hit both the rehab and sports performance worlds and it’s also being recognized as a potent tool for all of us aging baby boomers. There’s a lot of research that supports it, which is why Blood Flow Restriction or BFR is becoming more popular with athletes, physical therapists, trainers, and even celebrities like Mark Wahlberg. 
  
 While the idea has been around for decades, it’s only now that we’re seeing it becoming more mainstream...and largely because of our next guest, Dr. Jim Stray-Gundersen. Jim runs the SG Performance Medicine Center. He is also the chief medical officer of B STRONG, a Utah based company he co-founded in an effort to make blood flow restriction training safe, effective, and affordable for the general public.

   Growth happens when you step outside your comfort zone! A comfort zone is something you carry with you as you move through life. This comfort zone is very much like an invisible bubble of sorts that surrounds your psyche. And as you go about your day and encounter different circumstances, this bubble constantly expands and constricts depending on your situation. 
 Having peak performance in life and in fitness starts by seeking that edge, that threshold, and staying there.  If you can’t confront something that’s outside of your comfort zone, then you won’t venture forward. And you can’t expand. In other words, you keep yourself limited. 
 When it comes to this philosophy, Coach Bob Larsen was the master. When the running craze was in its infancy in the ‘70s, Coach Larsen took an unconventional group of young, rag-tag track and cross-country runners and launched them onto the national stage. During the course of his career, Coach Larsen developed sought-after training techniques that made him one of the greatest coaches of all time. 
 Our guest is Matthew Futterman, author of Running to the Edge, which presents a riveting account of visionary coach Bob Larsen, who changed the sport of running in America.
 The book is about the coach, the runners, and the training techniques. But even if you're not a runner, don’t miss this episode. There's a big takeaway for everyone, no matter what you do or who you are. This is a story about taking risks, stepping outside your comfort zone, changing your destiny, and knowing that if you work hard, you can do better tomorrow than you did yesterday.
 Matthew is a New York Times Deputy Sports Editor, and has previously worked for The Wall Street Journal, The Philadelphia Inquirer, and the Star-Ledger of New Jersey, where he was a part of the team that won the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News. And, Matthew is also an avid runner.
 For show notes, visit www.kathysmith.com/podcast. Today’s podcast is a 10-minute visualization that I recorded that helps you break old patterns and switch away from negative and limiting ideas and put your energy into more positive outcomes. 
 These types of visualizations are powerful. I like to start my morning routine with a visualization. Because it helps me focus on what I want to accomplish for the day… and I get so much more done! 
 Remember, your thoughts create our actions...your actions create your habits… our habits create our character… and your character becomes your destiny. 
 Where your focus goes, energy flows.

 In this episode we discuss a study comparing weightlifting vs. kettlebell training for strength, power, and body composition. The Scientific Strength Podcast is back! After a long hiatus, I explain why I'm bringing this project back to life - and how we can all benefit from this short podcast. This episode is just a short ""re-introduction"" to the Scientific Strength podcast. In this episode of Scientific Strength, we'll look at a new study comparing conventional straight bar deadlifts to hexagonal bar deadlifts. There's very limited research with this comparison, so this exciting new study sheds light on some of the key differences that are important to understand.  The Scientific Strength Podcast is back! This week we'll discuss an interesting study comparing a bodybuilding training regimen to a powerlifting regimen to evaluate muscular adaptations in well trained men. When volume is equal - is one approach better? We'll discuss in Episode 19.  There is a SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT in this week's show, so be sure to take a quick listen about the future of Scientific Strength. We also discuss a landmark study about the health consequences of prolonged sitting. Is sitting the new smoking? We'll discuss this week on the show. This week's show we'll cover a very simple and important functional test to assess general strength and mobility. Learn why this test is important and how we use it as a part of the functional performance process. This week on Scientific Strength. "

Explore cutting edge holistic lifestyle optimization with a focus on nutrition, environment, light, movement, and worldview. We use animal-based nutrition, the ketogenic diet, the carnivore diet, whole unrefined ancestral foods, regenerative agriculture, homesteading, and a holistic lifestyle approach for health, vitality, and optimal performance so we can thrive and bring others along for the ride. Build healthy bodies, homes, families, and communities together, because we are far more than what we eat.Hosted By: Tristan HaggardEmail: Tristan@primaledgehealth.com www.primaledgehealth.com Jon Venus, vegan fitness e-celeb, says he ate some eggs for a couple of days, so you don’t have to. RIP those poor eggs. Will he be tried for murduhr? Is Jon still vegan? Was he never really vegan? Jon Venus comes on for a chat with Tristan and Bobby’s Perspective, an outspoken former vegan who left the movement last year and is using a carnivore / keto approach to recover his health, which he says was ravaged by veganism. Vegan or Carnivore, which diet is the real game-changer for health and performance? Dr. Leo  Venus advocates a plant-based diet, Dr. Shawn Baker has eaten an all-meat diet for over 2 years. Who wins? PETA caught making deepfake videos, staging incidents, and doing all sorts of fookery. What's the real agenda behind PETA and ""animal rights""?

Dr. Joel Kahn has had a hard year...help him get his future back from the big mean grown-ups like Joe Rogan who refuse to go vegan. Fake steaks are the ""holy grail "" of fake meat made by industrial vegan kibble producers who tell us it's not ""natural"" or healthy to eat meat. This is beyond dumb.

David Attenborough and Netflix tell noble lies to get their future back and save the planet. Review of the plant-based #vegan documentary The Game Changers, produced by James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Should we all go #plantbased? Is #carnivore now debunked?  The legendary Dr. Greger shows his genius once again with a super hard vegan parlor trick. Dr. Neal Barnard makes a fool of himself with the politely skeptical host of London Real with absurd claims and nonsensical vegan rhetoric that expose his lack of sincerity. Kai Greene, top bodybuilder and huge fan of grapefruit, sells the plant-based dream."

DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY and USE AT YOUR OWN RISK Hello Friends! What a ride! As we wrap up Season 2 of As The Flywheel Spins, I want to offer our gratitude for those who are joining us on this journey. Your feedback and encouragement are what keep our passion to deliver you a variety of new and interesting ways to use your Concept2 machines. Season 2 was our opportunity to expand our workouts beyond the RowErg to the SkiErg and the BikeErg, as well. It has been exciting to realize how much more there is to work with!
Here were some of our favorite workouts through the season:
A Tale of the Charles - Rowing with Peter and Dick is an experience. They are masters of their machines. If anyone claims that rowing with the damper set to 1 is easy, this is the workout to convince you otherwise. Was it a challenge? Yes. Are you up for a challenge? I hope so!
Super Powers Activate - This workout has you on the BikeErg for a solid hour. You will go from a steady effort to your superhero effort. It's a fun, constantly changing, ever distracting, long workout.
Push the Pace - Pacing yourself on any of the Concept2 machines is difficult. Pacing yourself on SkiErg proves that point. To accomplish this workout successfully you must hold back, but just enough. You'll see.
These are just 3 of the 17 workouts of Season 2. There are so many more to check out if you haven't hit them all.  Even if you have hit them all, you can always repeat and note your progress! Each time you complete one, you might learn something new about yourself or the machines. This is your journey and we hope that offering up these workouts make your journey a little more diverse and exciting! 
Now, we are still getting used to this journey as well. Admittedly, Season 2 did not go quite as planned. The passionate hope was to deliver two workouts to you each week for the length of the season. We got 7 weeks in and we recognized that this was an unsustainable effort in time and energy to produce the same quality we had intended. So, we pulled production back to offering one workout each week from then on. That was hard, but it turned out to be a great decision on our side as it sets us up for a long road ahead. 
So, what's ahead? Well, every year Concept2 holds our Holiday Challenge where we encourage you to accumulate as many meters as you possibly can between November 28 and December 24. Once you reach over 100k, we donate to one of five charities on your behalf. This is our 20th anniversary of the challenge. As the Flywheel Spins will produce a few LONG workouts through the weeks of the challenge to help you achieve your goal!
After that, we will look forward to Season 3 of As The Flywheel Spins starting up January 1, 2020. I can't think of a better way to ring in the New Year! We will deliver a workout a week and have some really fun things to highlight that we think you will love to hear about. Rumor has it that we will be stepping out of our small little recording studio here at Concept2 and putting some miles behind our meters. You'll have to stay tuned to find out!
 
Until then, have a great day and enjoy As the Flywheel Spins."

Felicity was rocked by the news that she would never conceive children normally when diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS at only 24.

After struggling with her weight since her early 20s, she was diagnosed with PCOS and told she would likely never get pregnant. Felicity joins me on the podcast to share with you her story of discouragement followed by hope and a happy ending. You have to hear her story. So you’ve had bariatric surgery and you know some people take bariatric vitamins. But you’ve also heard they’re not necessary. Who’s right and why?
On today's podcast, Amanda Clark, bariatric dietitian and our podcast content director is here to help you cut thru the confusion surrounding bariatric multivitamins. Creator and author of the Portion Perfection kits for Weight loss (http://bit.ly/2qBd8hn ) and for Bariatrics (http://bit.ly/2k7U5Xz ), Amanda believes that when you see how much is right to eat, and you have practical tools to help you… you have a much greater understanding of what to do and how to do it.

He is a 4-time Individual and 4-time Team CrossFit Games Champion, as well as the owner of CrossFit Mayhem in Cookeville, Tennessee. Rich joins the BarBend Podcast to talk about hosting a Sanctional qualifier (the CrossFit Mayhem Classic), his honest reactions to CrossFit Games changes, and his future as a competitive athlete.  Dr. Pat Davidson and Jordan Shallow are both at the front of the pack leading the fitness industry and building better standards. Dr. Davidson has a PhD in exercise physiology and is an accomplished strength &amp; conditioning coach and author, while Dr. Shallow is a chiropractor, strength coach, and traveling presenter. Both of these individuals have brilliant minds when looking at and assessing basic and advanced training concepts and programs.    In today’s episode, Jake Boly takes commonly asked questions that we receive on BarBend Instagram posts, articles, and YouTube videos, and then has Dr. Davidson and Shallow answer them with free control. Stefi Cohen is one of the owners of Hybrid Performance Method. She holds a Doctorate in Physical Therapy, a CSCS, and has broken a total of 11 all-time powerlifting world records throughout her career. Additionally, Stefi is currently ranked #2 in the world for holding the all-time highest Wilks score with a remarkable 698.11, and continues to push the boundaries of what's physically possible for the human body.  In today’s episode, Jake Boly sits down with Stefi to chat on her upbringing in the sport of powerlifting and her mindset — but more importantly, how she has helped Hybrid Performance Method scale, along with tips for other business owners to do so. It can be scary to scale a business at times, however, Stefi explains if you equip yourself with the right tools and mindset, then it's manageable if it's a goal you possess. If you’re trying to grow your business — whether it be in the fitness industry or not — then we hope you love this chat! Weightlifter, coach, and YouTuber Zack Telander joins us to talk about transitioning back and forth between CrossFit and weightlifting. Zack also talks about setting realistic goals for weightlifting athletes, along with changing the paradigm of which sports are ""worth it"" in American culture. Zack also gives his thoughts on dealing with weightlifting data and the most underrated coach in American weightlifting. Joe Sullivan is a champion raw powerlifter who speaks his mind on everything from online trolls to bad gym etiquette. Joe joins us to talk training, his favorite powerlifters to watch this year, and an incredibly close (and internet famous) brush with disaster due to equipment failure.  Kris Gethin is a bodybuilder, fitness model, and supplement entrepreneur who has been the face of some of fitness' biggest physique campaigns. He's also a passionate endurance athlete who has a ton of knowledge on balancing muscle growth and strength gain with long-duration training for triathlons and distance events. We talk to Kris, the founder of Kaged Muscle, about these strategies and more."

In this week's podcast, I wanted to take time to share with you my resources, tips, and strategies, for including more whole foods into your diet!  Hey listeners! Happy New Year! In this week's episode, I wanted to take time to talk about what it means to push yourself and your passions out into the world through social media! This episode will discuss the main platforms that consume most of our attention: Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Tik Tok! What does it take to promote yourself and your passion on these platforms? Hey listeners!

Coach Glass Podcast,"The Coach Glass Podcast will help you take your coaching skills, fitness, personal brand and life to the next level. Every week you will enjoy Jason Glass's unique brand of Edutainment (Education through Entertainment). Join the community and get inspired! Maximize your potential and those around you! Dream Big & Over Deliver! Andrew Putnam is this week’s guest. If you are a fan of golf you will know that Andrew is a PGA Tour winner and #1 putter in the world. His success is founded in perpetual growth in all aspects of his life. Spiritual, mental, physical, emotional and relationships. I am very fortunate to have the opportunity to coach Andrew over the past 6 years but even more grateful for his friendship and the lessons he has taught me over this span. Enjoy! There are highs and lows along their path to greatness. Great coaches can identify and in many cases predict the dips in performance and plateaus and have the skill set to right the ship and efficiently get it back on the path. Some people think that great coaching takes technical skills, great eye for detail and a confident motivating presence. I think great coaching requires empathy, vulnerability and sincerity. But what do I know? If you are an athlete, injuries are inevitable. You may feel invincible but there is an injury in the mail, it just hasn’t reached you yet! If you want to minimize the affect of your injuries you need to truly understand what your injury is, how to treat it and when to return to battle. Once you understand what the injury is, you can decide the best way to treat it. Every New Year I perform an action that sets my year up for success.  I erase the entire hard drive on my computer and phone.  I know, I know, I know it sounds crazy!  Take a breathe and release your puckered balloon knot for a minute and let me explain.  What I am about to present to you isn’t just for your computer but for all aspects of your life! We go DEEP into rate of force, range of motion and how reducing one can increase the other and create amazing power gains. We talk speed, technique and long held myths about strength training. My favourite part of our conversations, always revolve around what it means to be a coach. We talk about our mentors and Al shares a story that will break your heart and inspire you to be a better coach! To all my Glisten’s around the globe....Happy Holidays! This annual Holiday Special is my way of sharing a Christmas Cheer with all of you. Every week we get to enjoy a coffee together but during the Holiday season my good friend Santa puts a little something special in my mug! I wish you all a fantastic holiday with your friends and family. If you have neither, you can rest your head on Christmas Eve knowing that you have a family here with the #GlistenerNation."

All Day Ruckoff Podcast,"Brian, founder of All Day Ruckoff, talks about rucking, gear, fitness, and GORUCK with those in the community. After completing GORUCK Challenge Class 053 Brian started the website All Day Ruckoff to encourage and provide insight to others who wanted to take on the GORUCK Challenge.

Listen to interviews with athletes, event organizers, cadre, ruck clubs, GORUCK employees, and those who make this community special. Completing one GORUCK Heavy is an accomplishment. Completing back to back GORUCK Heavy events is a huge accomplishment. Completing three back to back to back Heavy events is insane. Nick Schrein joins me in this podcast episode to talk about the one Triple Heavy GORUCK event that has ever been completed.







Nick gets into his endurance background, his training, and what happened during the GORUCK Triple Heavy event. After talking with him it becomes apparent just how absolutely insane this event. If you enjoy hearing about hard events or GORUCK history then I am sure you are going to love this episode.

Goal Setting 2020







* Write down (or find your list of) your 2019 goals.* Mark the goals you accomplished and the goals you didn’t accomplish.* Going through the goals you accomplished write why you were able accomplish them and what you did to accomplish them.* Going through the goals you didn’t accomplish write down why you didn’t accomplish them. Be honest so that you can use this as feedback for how to accomplish your goals in the future.* Write down two or three categories you want to focus on in 2020.* Within each category right down the goals that, if you completed, would help you improve that category.* Write down ways you can accomplish each individual goal.* Write down things that could prevent you from completing those goals.* Based on what could help you accomplish each individual goal start planning your year out high-level. Get an idea of what your calendar will look like to make sure it’s possible to complete.

The Champion Mindset,"Welcome to The Champion Mindset Podcast hosted by Stacy ""Bama"" Burr, who in 2019 put it all on the line to become the #1 ranked powerlifter in the world (#BITW). This is the #1 spot to find the motivation to grind out that one last rep, and the courage to take bigger and bigger steps towards being a better version of you. This is The Champion Mindset Podcast. When we do something new, something different, or strive for greatness, we always anticipate resistance. We anticipate what could go wrong, how that will make us feel, and where that resistance might take us, and most of the time, this anticipation keeps us from pursuing our dreams. Today, let’s talk about how to get through those feelings and how you can turn your apprehensions into your dreams. If you guys think that everything comes easy to me, you are wrong. Wrong, wrong. I struggle just like you, I fail just like you, but the question is, are you willing to keep trying like I am? Or are you going to give up and fall short of your goals? Competition is not designed to bring you down. Competition is to level you up. So let’s talk about it. Let’s talk about growth vs. scarcity mindset, how the world is not your competition, and how collaboration is probably the best possible thing for you and your personal development. It’s the little things that bring the biggest results. Today we talk about habits, and how habits shape our lives. If you have big goals, dreams, and ambitions for 2020, this episode was written for you. How are you going to accomplish your goals in 2020? Magic? Fairy dust? Unicorns and rainbows? No. Accomplishing goals starts with setting your expectations. This episode is a MUST for anyone who has goals and ambitions set for the New Year.

Applications for The Champion Mindset 30 Day Transformation Challenge will open soon! Keep your eyes peeled for the announcement. Will this be the year you finally go all-in on you? I don’t care what you do, what your passion is, or why you’re doing it, I only care that you go all in. May this be the year you finally give something your everything."

Vigor Life Podcast,"Luka Hocevar is the owner of the nationally renowned Vigor Ground Fitness and Performance gym in Seattle and founding father of Vigor Move & Live in Slovenia, featured in Men's Health, Stack Magazine, Onnit Magazine, Entrepreneur Magazine, and on CBS. As a leading fitness and personal development coach this Vigor Life podcast is an extension of what Luka coaches every day and will provide tips, stories, motivation and inspiration to help you forge daily habits for a better body—through fitness, nutrition and mindset—build better relationships, create purpose in your career/business, increase productivity, be happier, and succeed (success comes from succession as in the ""next step"" - constant growth and expansion in your life).  The Vigor Life podcast will help you piece together the puzzle pieces to your own extraordinary life. Years ago I crashed and burned. The cause of my burnout was a decade of working like crazy and not sleeping enough... to the tune of 3-4 hours a night. This led me to go to the doctor and get tests done. The results of those tests led me to overhaul my health and prioritize sleep. I’ve done a podcast on sleep before, but when I heard Nick Lambe's talk at an event we were both speaking at, I knew I needed to bring him on the show. 















Nick spends the most of his time coaching clients on how to fix their sleep patterns. Sleep—more specifically, getting enough sleep—is an important topic that, for many of you, may be the single most important thing you can do to help your health, wellness, performance, and happiness in 2020.







In this episode Nick and I talk about the real world ways you can help improve sleep, the real dangers of not sleeping enough, as well as the practical tactics and strategies that Nick uses to get results for his clients. We also talk about how coaches can (and should) educate themselves on the importance of sleep. In particular, how to help improve the sleep patterns of their clients. 







This episode will give you strategies that will not only benefit your life, but also help you get better results, and become more valuable to your clients.







Let's go.















IN THIS EPISODE YOU’LL LEARN:







* How Nick, a strength and conditioning coach, became a sleep coach.* How improving your sleep will improve every area of your life and make you a better and nicer person.* How to know if you're putting enough emphasis on sleep.* Why most chronic sleep issues are behavioural, but can start with a life event such as an injury, new career or stress. We discuss how to overcome the issue so that it doesn't become a pattern.* How thoughts can affect your sleep and create a vicious cycle of insomnia.* Why people are affected by sleep and the practical lessons you can apply to your life to change bad sleep patterns into good ones. We give some powerful real world examples which you will be able to apply to your life. * Why sleep MUST be coached to clients and not just given to them as a “sleep hygiene” list.* Why what you associate your bedroom with is critical for quality sleep. Learn the “2S” acronym that is the only thing you should be using it for.* Blue screens aren’t as bad as we think. Nick shares what you should really focus on.* The 3 big reasons you should get rid of your sleeping pills now!* Powerful and practical insights that can improve your sleep fast.







And much more.

Vigor Life Podcast (iTunes): https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/vigor-life-podcast/id1180256583?mt=2 I've known Dr. John Rusin for over 6 years now – both as a friend and  colleague. In that time I've had the pleasure of hosting John at four events, including the PPSC certification – which brought together 110 coaches from all over the world. In 2020 John's Pain Free Performance Training Certification course will be certifying close to 5,000 coaches all over the world because it straight up works. 















I love talking with John on the podcast because it's a chance for us to catch up and discuss how our thinking and experience around training has evolved. In particular, what we do with clients to get the absolute best results.







In this episode I talk to John about sequencing, quality of reps, the structure of a great training session, rep ranges, pump work, and everything in between. Expect some great insights that will help you improve the training and coaching of your clients as well as your own training.







Let's go.















IN THIS EPISODE YOU’LL LEARN:







* How to use John’s P4 model (Prepare, Prime, Perform, Pump) in your own training to maximize gains * The biggest mistake people make when taking a one dogmatic approach to their training* The definition of the “meathead de-load” and why you’re probably doing it (and why you shouldn’t!)* What a  true max effort method lift is and how you can rotate exercises and reps for maximal results and pain-free performance* Why you should only “sprinkle in” true max effort reps and have them be absolutely pristine* Why the volume in a program should come from pain-free volume in the supplement and assistance work in training * Why the KEY to working on your reps is based on your daily performance NOT on structured percentages (we reveal some methods we use)* Why it’s not the smartest training 4 big lifts in the 1-5 rep range in the same session and what ranges to use* How to use energy system training to enhance your recovery and bring your lifts up (yes, cardio can bring your lifts up!)* Novelty and why it’s so important for buy in – as well as getting better results* How to make a BIG difference with “slight variations” in your daily training programs and how it addresses the dynamic stability* How to de-construct the program for someone that has been in pain and switch it up so they get stronger and build muscle pain-free* How to apply tools, methods, and exercises you like into your programming and STILL stick to the principles that will help you succeed with your training







And much, much more.

Luka Hocevar YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ29YcBh-g6onRujX3wD_XA? When I first met James Foster a little over 6 years ago it was an instant connection. At the time, we were both helping each other grow. Myself helping him grow his BJJ dojo, and him teaching me BJJ. But the lessons did not end there.















James, a 20 year BJJ veteran, has been highly respected in the BJJ community for a long time. In the the last 6 years however, he has made some serious achievements both personally and professionally. His two most notable achievements are being named the 3x ultra-heavyweight BBJ World Champion, while also growing his dojo to the biggest in Washington State with an ever growing program for kids.







In this episode we talk about everything from mindset, to practice, and the “secret” to becoming the best in the world. We also dive into how to apply these lessons to your life – whether you're coming from the world of business or not. We also talk about the art and science of coaching and the importance of it in every training session and moment.







Let's go.















IN THIS EPISODE YOU’LL LEARN:







* The principles and characteristics of a champion that breed success in sport, coaching, business and life* Why you need to ""be real"" with yourself, and respect / know that being perfect isn't the key to success* Why leading from the front in your business is a must, despite the cliché. We breakdown what it actually means to lead from the front* The reason why competing will give you a reality check in how good you are* What “IASM” means and why it’s a key to charging more and valuing yourself more in business and life* The foundational skillsets and mindsets of an excellent coach* Why it’s important to take advice from people that have been there, done that, and are STILL doing it – and how this will help you achieve longevity* Why knowledge + experience + results + longevity = a great coach  * Why you CAN learn from everyone and the importance of keeping an ""empty cup"", especially if you're a young and/or new coach* How to earn your respect in the industry, grow your business and do what most aren’t!* Why you must never lose the pulse of your culture in your business, or anything else in life if you want to improve* Why you should always work on the things you’re not good at







And a lot more.

I’ve spent the last two decades studying with the best of the best to learn how to get the best results (through training) for myself and my clients. A standout lesson in my years of training and experimentation came from Mike Robertson and Bill Hartman. These two very smart men gave me a structure that simplified what to include in each session, along with a lens to view my programs through to ensure that I'm getting the best results for my clients, and myself. Their method has since became the framework for how we write most of our training programs here at Vigor Ground for both our personal and group training clients. 















In this episode I break down each “R” of the R7 system and the principles and science behind it. I also go into what it looks like in the real world of exercises and programs.







This is a must listen if you train clients.







Let's go.















IN THIS EPISODE YOU’LL LEARN:







* Why most people are living on the “fight or flight” part of the spectrum of their nervous system, when they should instead address the first two “R’s” in their program to ensure that they're getting the best results out of their training* Why people can foam roll and warm up too much and then not get the results from training* What “Release” is and how it can be a huge factor in feeling better and performing better in your training* The R7 protocol and how it creates a flow of the training session from low intensity to high intensity to recovery* How to decrease stiffness and pain and improve mobility. I give you the specific strategy* How to improve biomechanics position and autonomic balance* Why if you have to foam roll everything you’re doing it WRONG, and why this is a tell tale sign that you need to check your program!* How to restore position, balance inhalation vs exhalation, improve mobility with two exercises in the “Reset” stage* The most powerful reset you have in your arsenal is high quality exercise technique and program design* The three-step process to warm up in your “Readiness” stage* The warm up that sets the stage for your entire workout, and how to make it a priority in your training sessions* Why everyone should do reactive/power work, whether in private, semi-private, or groups – from pro athletes to 70-year olds * Programming from the neural to the metabolic spectrum and how to use it in your programs







And much, much, more.

Thanks so much for joining me this week. Have some feedback that you’d like to share? Leave me a review on a href=""https://itunes.apple. Recently I was down in San Diego for an event my friend Craig Ballantyne was putting one. While there Jay Ferruggia and I decided to take the opportunity to visit the famous Glute Lab to train with our friend Bret Contreras. AKA “The Glute Guy.” Apart from a great training session, we got to talking about training, which led to this podcast episode.















In it you'll get some powerful insights on program design, joint-friendly training, building muscle (at any age) and how to stay in the game forever – along with some industry secrets, and much much more.







The three of us have a combined 60 years of coaching experience under our belts, and have been training personally for 25 years or more years (each). This hour of power is a look into what works in the real world, and why we were wrong about some things that we only learned through decades of experience coaching clients.







This is a ""must listen"" episode if you're a coach.







Let's go.















IN THIS EPISODE YOU’LL LEARN:







* The big mistakes most people make when programming for building muscle and why you will fail if you do this* Why you’re doing too much and not doing it well enough* Why talking smack about machines was mistake and why we love machines and how to use them* Why joint-friendly training is the solution for long-term strength, muscle, performance, and feeling great* The exact model Bret uses to get people results month in and month out, for the long haul (steal it!)* Jay’s secret on sequencing exercises and why NOT to start the day with the big lifts - this is a game changer when you implement it* How I cycle bilateral and unilateral exercises as main exercises, rotate joint-friendly lifts, and change the reps of my PR’s to constantly improve * What should you focus on the most: Intensity, Volume, Frequency?* The ideal training splits for most people and the break down of what has been the “bread n' butter” in getting results for our clients us for decades* The key to longevity in the fitness game as coach. We share our wisdom from decades of work and many mistakes







And much more.

This episode is a must listen if you have ever struggled to reach a goal in the past. It's also a must of you coach people in any capacity.







Let's go.















IN THIS EPISODE YOU’LL LEARN:







* Why thinking bigger and bolder is a MUST—not selfish or “unrealistic”* My realization of having to do more of less, and why destroying yourself with work will prevent you from changing your life and your business* Why I believe that every day that you hesitate to share your gift with the world is selfish. And why I started creating more once I realized this truth* Omnipresence – why being everywhere all the time can help you, and how to do it* The 5 questions that will have you set your ego aside and help you grow from week-to-week * Why you may think you know better, but you don't. And how to change this mindset if you have it* How to be more resilient and anti-fragile—which is foundational in the world of entrepreneurship (and life in general)* The way I deal with struggle and turn it around to strengthen my mindset and resolve* 3 things you must do on a daily basis in the “mindset gym” to become unstoppable* And much more…

The Confidence Project,"Helping women achieve confidence through a no-nonsense, yet sustainable approach to diet and exercise. Bridging the gap between learning how to love yourself while being a badass. The Barbell Collective Waitlist
 
 If you work out RIGHT, you can work out LESS👇🏽
 
 You have a full life. Your days are busy and long. You’re craving time to do whatever you want, free of “shoulds”, free of pressure and without worrying about how much you’ll beat yourself up over allowing yourself to simply exist for one freakin’ second without cramming every. single. thing. that needs to get done into your day.
 
 You’re not lazy. In fact, you’re the opposite. You’re so NOT lazy that you’re overworked, stressed, tired- and on the verge of burnout from trying to keep it together all the time- keeping the plates spinning on their sticks.
 
 MARGIN (my definition): room to exist. To play. To decompress. Wiggle room. The nap gap (TM- I’m gonna trade mark that!)
 
 There was a time I didn’t understand how to “do it all” without “doing more.” My work ethic made me feel like if I had any margin I wasn’t working hard enough. Then I realized I wanted some wiggle room and a freakin’ nap gap. And I wanted to find it without losing progress or babying myself.
 
 I was spending 20+ hours a week working out. Equivalent to a part time job with nothing to show for it but wasted time, fatigue, and maybe 1 ounce of extra muscle than I have now...? Looking back, it feels so silly. And it was.
 
 So I explored what I could get away with. How much do I REALLY have to do to gain/maintain my strength and fitness? And who the hell am I with margin in my life if I’m “only” working out 4-5 hours per week?
 
 Turns out, if you’re working out RIGHT, you can actually workout LESS. And it’ll cost you absolutely nothing, yet it’ll grant you margin. Margin to to do whatever you want, without having to negotiate or bargain or sacrifice a single thing. No brainer, right?
 
 It can feel scary to have extra time. But if you could do what you want to do and feel how you want to feel AND have wiggle room, play room, and a nap gap- wouldn’t you do it? If you could spend less time and make more progress, wouldn’t you do it? Get on The Barbell Collective waitlist You might want a pen and paper out for this one! This episode is like a mini seminar- you'll want to take notes for SURE!
 
 Full disclosure: I totally screw up in this episode and start saying ""4 things you need""- but, it's FIVE THINGS- &amp; we're here, I'm not perfect, and it's all good, so we're keeping it.
 
 This is such an exciting (and nerve wracking) episode for me to release- it's almost like an entire identity crisis. Coming from the girl who worked 7 days a week for years on end, no days off, no weekends, no holidays- just constantly grinding trying to make it work- I've planted seeds a few years ago that are in FULL FREAKIN' BLOOM this year and I'm so excited to reap what I've sown.
 
 Every day is like a Friday for me this year, and I'm so pumped to teach you exactly what kinds of seeds you need to start planting now to help you get out of the grind, and hopefully in just a short while- you'll too be able to set up your business so that every day feels like a Friday for you, too!
 
 You can join the Biz Beehive email list here.
 You can apply to work with me 1:1 inside your biz here. In today's episode, I'm giving you the exact step by step process you need to audit your life. It might take a couple hours once you get down into it, but I promise it will change the way you look at your goals, your progress, or perhaps... lack thereof.
 
 But, it's all OK. At the end of today's episode, you'll know what to do, what to look for, and what it means. And at the end- you get to decide! Do you like how it's all going? Or do you want to make a change? You'll have more clarity at the end of today's episode.

 On today's episode, Laura and I talk about some of the taboo topics in women's health like pelvic floor health including urinary and fecal incontinence, working out during and after pregnancy, and how bad is ""bad enough"" when it comes to seeking help from a professional in the Physical Therapy space.

 (904) 296-4140 You probably hate that your following is so small.
 And want more followers.
 And want a million clients.
 Am I right?
 
 I used to want more of everything, too. Until I realized I could do BETTER and MORE with LESS.
 If your following is on the smaller side and if the amount of clients you have is also on the smaller side (think: less than ~100 or so) you have SUCH A HUGE ADVANTAGE- and you need to leverage the s**t out of it.
 
 This episode will talk about the ways in which my businesses stand out amongst the rest- and it's all because I have taken serious advantage over my small following AND the small amount of clients I have.
 
 If you keep chasing more, more, more- you're potentially crapping all over the opportunity for IMPACT you have sitting right in front of you.

The Art and Science of Running,"Discussions of the intersection of the art and science of running. In this episode of the Art and Science of Running Podcast, we speak with elite ultramarathoner, artist &amp; scientist, Geoffrey Burns, about his research at the University of Michigan in kinesiology &amp; biomechanics, specifically with regard to foot strike, cadence, and running form. In addition to discussions about Geoff’s research, we spoke with him about his proposal to regulate running footwear innovation and his rationales behind his proposals. This led us to discussions about his role as a professional athlete and a scientist navigating the sometimes conflicting realms of sponsorship, authenticity, objectivity, and professionalism. 







Athletic Resume







Geoff grew up running in Southern California before walking-on to the cross country and track teams at the University of Michigan where he ran for the legendary Coach Ron Warhurst. Geoff is passionate about the sport of running and has competed at the highest levels winning national ultrarunning championships and placing as high as 5th at the world 100K championships. But Geoff is more than a great runner. He takes his writing and science seriously.







Academic and Professional Background







Geoff studied biomedical engineering at the University of Michigan and received bachelor’s and master’s degrees before working professionally as an engineer in medical devices and orthopedic surgery research. After some time in the professional sector, Geoff returned to the University of Michigan to pursue a PhD in kinesiology and biomechanics. At the time of the recording, Geoff was months away from defending his thesis.







Cadence and Changing Foot Strike Patterns







One of the many topics we discussed with Geoff is the trend toward trying to change one’s foot strike or cadence.  Regarding cadence and step rate, Geoff explained, 







“It’s a barometer and not a governor. There’s no magical number that’s dogmatically right for everybody.” Geoff Burns reflecting on the commonly held belief that there is a “magic” number of steps per minute 







Read these articles  for additional insight on foot strike and cadence.







What are the Benefits and Risks Associated with Changing Foot Strike Pattern During Running? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Injury, Running Economy, and Biomechanics







The Perfect Stride: Can Alberto Salazar straighten out American dist... In this episode of the Art and Science of Running Podcast we speak with runner, scientist, and journalist, Alex Hutchinson about the role the mind plays in endurance and performance. Alex blends his passions for science and writing in the Sweat Science column of Outside Magazine. Prior to writing for Outside, Alex studied physics at the University of Cambridge while competing and representing Canada as a long-distance runner. 







After earning a PhD in physics and working on some post-doctoral research, Alex pivoted to journalism where he earned a National Magazine Award for his work with Popular Mechanics, covered adventure travel for The New York Times, and wrote a training column for Runner’s World. 







Books







His latest book, ENDURE: Mind, Body, and the Curiously Elastic Limits of Human Performance, is not simply about about physics or physiology, but dedicates significant portions to the workings of the mind. Endure comes highly recommended by other experts in the realms of sport and science most notably David Epstein, Amby Burfoot, Tim Noakes, and Malcolm Gladwell.







Alex’s first book, Which Comes First, Cardio or Weights? Fitness Myths, Training Truths, and Other Surprising Discoveries from the Science of Exercise exemplifies the breadth of his writing about running.







PhD in Physics to Journalism







In our interview, Malc who was also formally trained as a physicist in the UK, asked Alex how he decided to transition from a career in physics to a career in journalism. In response, Alex shared some insight into why he chose to study physics in the first place based on the advice of a mentor:







“If you don’t know what you want to do, do something hard and it will train your mind. The problem solving skills will be transferrable to other domains. If you show that you can do something hard and challenge yourself it’s easier to do that than study basket weaving for four years and then decide to be a physicist.”







After four years of studying physics, Alex still didn’t know what to do so I went to grad school. After grad school he still didn’t know what to do so did a post doc. Then he had an “awakening moment.” After working in a lab for 14 hours a day a colleague came back and asked if I had read an article in the latest journal. He was reading physics for fun after working in physics all day for work. Alex was doing physics because it was hard, but it wasn’t what he wanted to do at the end of a long day working in the lab. He had other interests and felt that journalism might allow him to continue to learn and explore other aspects of life outside of the lab. 







Alex did a one year master’s degree in journalism to show that he was serious, rather than simply jumping into an internship and assuming it would just come to him. While writing for the Ottawa Citizen, Alex learned that he does his best work when he writes about things that he really cares about.  







Journalism gave Alex something to work towards – a column dedicated to running – whereas in the field of physics the only thing that came after studying physics was more physics. Journalism has a lot of career switchers and is open to those from othe... In this episode of the Art and Science of Running podcast, Jacob Puzey and Malc Kent explain how to periodize and prioritize training, racing, and recovery to avoid injury. 







Periodization







There are essentially two approaches to training and racing – linear and non-linear periodization. 







Linear Periodization







The most common approach to training and racing among elites is a linear periodization focusing on one or two goal races per year. While this practice may be followed by amateur athletes, the vast majority of recreational runners simply train from race to race. 







The purpose of this discussion is not to say whether one approach is right or wrong, but rather to identify the pros and cons of each approach, determining which approach will work best for you, and what considerations to take into account when designing a training and racing schedule. 







Periodization can simply be defined as breaking up a training cycle for a specific purpose by starting from a target and reverse engineering to the start / current place and time.. 







The essential questions of periodization are:







How do you get from where you are today to where you want to be?







What do you need to do between now and the target date / race to prepare for the demands of the challenge?







Jacob has written about the pros and cons and ways to design training based on both models in the following articles:







RACE STRATEGICALLY







RUNNING AND EGGS







WIN THE RACE OF PREPARATION







However, prior to commencing formal, specific training make sure that your body is functioning optimally. The off-season (or a break between goal races) is the best time to identify and work on weaknesses. For many, winter is a natural off-season from race specific training. Once you get started on a training block it is much harder to start correcting things.







Start with the End in Mind







Periodization changes depending on what your goal is. To a pure classical strength coach that might look different than a pure running coach or a gait analyst, but regardless of the role or goal of a coach or athlete, we can all agree that it is important to reset at the end of each season.







Malc suggests that you start out with foundation work early on. Start with a gait analysis to determine what inefficiencies, deficiencies, or asymmetries you may have and begin to work on addressing them before getting to far into race specific run training. 







Malc described a flow chart from left to right.







First thing in the flow of actions is Gait Analysis. 







Measure some numbers and see where you’re at. Then see if / how you are improving. 







Corrective training – Look at data and then work on qualities that you want to develop.







Strength endurance and then speed strength and then power.







Initial analysis / data collection -&gt; Foundation / correction -&gt; Develop strength, power, speed







It’s All About the Base In this episode of the Art and Science of Running Podcast we speak with Dr. Carla Rodriguez Dimitrescu about nutrition for endurance events, particularly long-distance running. Carla is a national champion ultrarunner who has competed internationally in running and swimming. She recently returned from the 24 Hour World Running Championships in France and shares some of the lessons she learned. Carla studied Nutrition and Metabolism in Mexico, the USA, and Canada and eventually earned a PhD in Nutrition and shares some of her insight in experience with us to help maximize training, racing, and recovery. 







Carla’s athletic career started early while still a young girl in Mexico. Eventually, she found running while warming up and for dry land training for swimming. After a 12 minute running test with her swimming teammates, Calra realized that she was actually quite good at running and began taking it a bit more seriously. 







As a teenager, Carla participated in modern pentathlon while also specializing in the 200m Butterfly in the pool.. When she began studying formally in university, Carla took a break from competitive swimming.  She decided at a young age to be nutritionist and ultimately earned a PhD in clinical nutrition while concurrently working in Sports Nutrition. Carla is also a Certified Sports Nutritionist. 







The underlying theme of Carla’s message is that “we need to learn to listen to our bodies.”







Are night shades inflammatory or anti-inflammatory?







“Everyone is different. If we perform a study of 15-20 people we’ll get results, but that doesn’t mean it is applicable to everyone. The more we study. The more we realize how different we are. The more we study the more questions we have. We are extremely complex. “







“Try to eat local. That’s how you can better control the quality of the foods that you eat.”







“Keep a journal about the foods that you eat and how they impact you.”







24 Hour World Championships in Albi, France







Calra recently competed in the 24 Hour World Championships in Albi, France. We discuss the challenges of travel, time change, foreign foods, different types of water, thirst, and language barriers. 







Training and fitness felt good, but ultimately Carla had challenges with the water. There were so many water options that she inadvertently purchased and consumed the wrong type of water. The kind that she purchased and used in the race had a higher calcium content that she was accustomed to so it didn’t sit well with the family.







Carla fuelled with a combo of gels and electrolyte drinks as well as Fanta or Orange Crush.







When travelling it can be hard to find food that sit well and that you are familiar with. To further complicate things, restroom facilities can be different as well.







Carla felt a great sense of pride running and representing her home country of Mexico. 







Omar, her spouse, crewed for her and helped her take care of her nutritional needs. 







The championship event in France was a looped course so she could see family, friends, and team every 1.5 km. 







One thing that stood out to Carla was how animated the French fans were.







For the first 6 hours Carla was on personal record pace, but then she began feeling the stabbing pain in her stomach caused by the calcium in the water. Despite a fast first 80K, In episode 11 of the Art and Science of Running Podcast we visit with Tommy Rivers Puzey. Tommy is a husband, father, accomplished marathoner, trail and ultra runner, iFit Trainer, anthropologist, linguist, doctor of physical therapy and licensed massage therapist who works on some of the best endurance athletes in the world when they are training in his hometown of Flagstaff, Arizona.







What motivates Tommy to get out the door and run?







“Trying to keep my own mental and physical health in check. Movement outside helps me keep my own emotional health.”







“The first biggest motivator is to get my head on straight before the rest of the day starts.”







“There are few people whose company I enjoy as much as the voices in my own head.”







“More than anything, I’m motivated by fear of not reaching my potential.”







What was it like growing up in the Puzey home?







“We always knew that we were loved, but there was always an expectation to excel.”







What motivated Tommy to pursue the academic tracks that he pursued?







“Our dad taught us from a young age that you can either work with your hands or you can work with your mind. If you choose to work with your mind, you have to go to college and if you want to go to college I’m not going to pay for it so you either have to be a scholar or an athlete or both.”







“We knew that if we wanted to work with our minds that we needed to go to college so we tried to become the best students and athletes that we could be so that we could pay for college.”







“Waste of any kind is sinful. Waste of food, waste of time, waste of opportunity. Waste of potential is the very worst form of waste.”







“Anthropology class felt like Sunday dinner with our family. It just felt like home being in the anthropology department and that’s what Jake was studying so that’s what I did.”







When did athletics come into the picture?







“Our recreation as kids was simply being outside in the rural southwest.”







“You learn to run as kids and then you are told to stop and then eventually listen. Whether it’s for church, or school, or the pool. We learned to run as kids and we just never stopped.”







Tommy has had success on the trails and the roads. Some find the transition back and forth difficult.







How does he specifically target specific types of running races?







“I start my weeks from the back to the front. . . People have these preconceived notions that you are either a trail runner or a road runner. One of the first things I learned about when I first started studying human physiology is Wolff’s Law. Wolff’s Law essentially says that bones will strengthen themselves. The fibres of the bones will align themselves specifically in response to the stresses that are placed upon them. If you stress a tissue or blood or tendon a little bit those tissues will make adaptations and become what they are being trained to become. If you stress it too much without adequate recovery you will get injured.”







Tommy’ weekly training schedule:







* Five days a week Tommy does what he calls the Vuelta del Taco Run which is 10 miles from his home on a dirt mountain road to a href=""https://www.deltaco. In this episode of the Art and Science of Running podcast we speak with international trail and ultrarunning superstar, Manu Vilaseca.







In this conversation, long-time coach, Jacob Puzey, chats with Manu about her experiences at UTMB, moving to a new country and learning a new language, cross training, training for a stage race, and how coaching has helped her become a better runner.







They also discuss how Manu’s background as a multi-sport athlete training in Brazil has informed the way that she trains and coaches those she coaches in Catalunya and beyond. They specifically discuss the old school HIIT workouts, Cruz Intervals, named affectionately after Brazilian mid-distance star, Joaquim Cruz that Manu and Jacob suggest for some of their athletes to work on speed, agility, and power – especially when they aren’t able to train on trails.







Manu hails from Rio de Jainero, Brazil, and currently resides in Moiá, Catalunya where she and her partner, Gerard Morales, lead a group of athletes known as Team Peak Run Moiá.







Manu has a background in product design and a gift for learning languages. She loves travelling to races around the world and learning about the people and the places she explores on foot. To date, Manu speaks Catalan, English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish.







Manu has placed top ten at two of the uber competitive UTMB races, UTMB and TDS and has been ranked top ten in the Ultra Trail World Tour for her top performances at internationally competitive ultramarathons around the world. In 2019, Manu placed 5th at TDS in what she describes as one of the most challenging courses she has encountered thus far.







In addition to training together, Manu and Gerard will be teaming up to to tackle the Everest Trail Race in Nepal.  Manu ran it last year and will be returning with her partner to see how they fair against the altitude and the elements.







All of this and more in Episode 10 of the Art and Science of Running Podcast.

For more on the sub 2 topic, you can read his original  research paper on the topic, this more recent article, plus a good  Runner's World article on the topic.   GAIN 2020 is coming up in June and today we're announcing all the details about this year's event. Once again GAIN is bringing together some of the top minds from a variety of fields and sports. Listen in to this week's GAINcast for a full preview of the event, including background on all of our presenters and an inside look at what will be new in 2020.

  The GAINcast is brought to you by GAIN and HMMR Media. Applications for GAIN are now open and you can learn more here, including links to all our past interviews with faculty members, registration information, and more. Looking back to move forward may at first seem counterintuitive, but by looking back you can gain perspective. On this week's GAINcast we look ahead towards a new year and a new century. But to do so we first look back and discuss how we can mine our own experiences and the experiences of others to see what the future of training entails.

  The GAINcast is brought to you by GAIN and HMMR Media. Registration for GAIN 2020 will open up in mid-January. This month's theme on HMMR Media is the future of training. Stay tuned for more on the topic throughout the month and join HMMR Plus so that you get full access to our video, article, and podcast archive here on HMMR Media. Vern also covered this topic in a blog post today. You can learn more about a few of the classic training ideas we discussed in the episode:  Mach sprint drills and training ideas from John Jesse. Tendons and other connective tissue are often thought of as non-trainable, but more and more research is showing that they are more responsive to load than we thought. Professor Keith Baar is a leading researcher on the topic and joins this week's GAINcast to talk about how connective tissue works together with muscles and bones to produce movement. We also dive into how connective tissue can be trained, as well as several other topics he has been researching.

  The GAINcast is brought to you by GAIN and HMMR Media. Join HMMR Plus so that you get full access to our video, article, and podcast archive here on HMMR Media. This month's theme on HMMR Media is reactive strength, with some great new resources from  Warren Young and many other leaders on the topic. Baar 's full background can is outlined in his UC Davis faculty biography and information about the Functional Molecular Biology Lab. You can also find him on Twitter (@MuscleScience). You can download some of Baar's research via ResearchGate and also watch a great lecture on training to improve musculoskeletal performance on YouTube. Togetherness is not a term you hear about often in training, but all good programs have it. They connect together teammates. They connect together the assets of various staff members. They connect together on field and off field work. They connect strength and skill. The longer Calvin Morriss coaches, the more important this aspect of training is. On this week's GAINcast, Morriss joins us to discuss how interconnected training is and how his role with World Rugby helps smaller nations connect the dots.

How do we maintain it? On this week's GAIN cast we bring together a roundtable with guests James Marshall and Steve Myrland to discuss the topic from all angles.

Linchpin Conversations,"Linchpin Conversations is a podcast covering health, fitness, personal development and random musings regarding life. Part 2 of a 12 part series dissecting the CF Linchpin 12 Tests. In this episode we dive into Linchpin Test 2. The Linchpin 12 Tests, aka, the Dirty Dozen are 12 benchmark workouts we created to help athletes and coaches assess their fitness across a broad range of movements, loadings, rep ranges and time domains. All 12 Tests can be found on our website at www.CrossFitLinchpin.com I also answer a couple of nutrition questions, one specifically about the Zone diet. I revisit an article I wrote in 2015 entitled ""A Reflection on 10 years of CrossFit"". The article lists 10 lessons learned. I review the article to see if I would change anything now that another 5 years have passed. Questions from the community are answered: 1. What is the best way to get back into working out after traveling, specifically international travel? 2. What is the best way to get back into working out after being sick? -Tips for staying on track while traveling, staying in hotels and recovering from illness are provided. We answer questions submitted from the internet: ""How do you recognize the difference between your training helping you vs hurting you?"" and ""If a lack of strength is holding an athlete back, should they keep the rx'd loading &amp; scale the reps, or is it better to scale the loading &amp; keep the rx'd reps to maintain intensity?"". And of course, we also went down a couple of wonderful rabbit holes. Part 1 of a 12 part series dissecting the CF Linchpin 12 Tests. In this episode we dive into Test 1. The Linchpin 12 Tests, aka, the Dirty Dozen are 12 benchmark workouts we created to help athletes and coaches assess their fitness across a broad range of movements, loadings, rep ranges and time domains. All 12 Tests can be found on our website at www.CrossFitLinchpin.com We discuss the 10 General Physical Skills from the foundational CrossFit Journal Article entitled ""What is Fitness?"", from October 2002. This topic was inspired by a question from a member of the Linchpin community who wanted to know about the various aspects we hope to develop when we work out."

 www.shelbyrowproductions.com In this week's episode, I had the pleasure of interviewing my Friends With Benefits group coaching client, Dr Roma Amin.
 Dr Amin is a family physician who was kind enough to open up and share her dieting struggles as she navigated medical residency while simultaneously planning a wedding. During this stressful time in her life, Roma, often turned to food as a way to delay studying or ""reward"" herself for surviving another hard day.
 Despite being a medical professional who understands the intricate ins and outs of the human body, Dr Roma struggled with the psychological aspect of dieting. After years of losing and regaining the same 15-20 pounds, she finally reached her breaking point and joined my Friends With Benefits program to put her dieting struggles behind her once and for all.
 In this episode, Dr Amin and I discuss:
   The biggest challenges Roma faced as an emotional eater and how she was able to overcome these obstacles through accountability and group support.  How measuring progress through habit tracking and non-scale victories (instead of scale weight) has contributed to successful weight loss she can maintain for the rest of her life.  Interestingly, Roma shares what percentage of her patients are overweight and how this has had a profound effect on other aspects of their health.  What holiday and social eating looks like for her now compared to years previous (hint: no more food anxiety or fear of being out of control)  Dr Amin's shares her 3 BEST pieces of advice for those who fear they'll gain weight if they stop calorie counting and focus on weight loss through behavior change.  ...and so much more! You definitely DONT want to miss this insightful episode. Give it a listen and let us know what you think in the comments!

 www.shelbyrowproductions.com In this episode, I had the pleasure of interviewing my current client, Andrea Seabrands, who was a Weight Watchers member for 15 years -- eventually becoming one of their leaders.
 As a former leader, Andrea was able to share an exclusive look into Weight Watchers behind the scenes and elaborates on why she ditched the point counting in exchange for a more mindful approach.
 Topics discussed:
 How diets like WW keep you struggling and why using a habit-based approach has allowed Andrea to feel in control around food.
 What it's like to transition away from a food-obsessed chronic dieter to someone who effortlessly maintains their weight.
 At what point in the process the habits began to *click* and become more automated.
 Why she referred a friend to work with me but was reluctant to get started on making the change for herself.
 The three things Andrea wished she knew at the beginning of the program and her best piece of advice for anyone who fears gaining weight when dropping the restrictive food rules, calorie counting, and mind-numbing cardio.

 - What happens psychologically when we fail to achieve our goals and why this can be harmful to us in the longterm.

 - How you can make 2020 different from previous years by learning from your mistakes and embracing a different, battle-tested process. In this episode, Rog Law and I talk about how to stop caring about what other people think about your physique.
 
 Topics discussed:
 - Why we went to care how other people view us and scenarios in which this tends to appear.
 - How to identify if how much we care is becoming a problem that needs to be addressed before it spirals out of control.
 
 - The #1 goal to set in learning how to overcome this issue.
 
 - Immediately actionable ways that you can begin to reverse the tide and release the shackles of other people's opinion in terms of your body.

Miz Unfiltered,"Miz Unfiltered is a place to get your ear candy. We talk about lifestyle, psychology, creativity, comedy, fitness, nutrition, business, and so much more. Uncut and Unfiltered, let’s explore. Your host is Misbah Haque - Stand Up Comedian, Coach at Revival Strength, and a serial podcaster. You can find his other podcasts by heading over to mizhq.com. Or search for: Look Good Move Well and The Unfiltered Human. Misbah talks about using an exercise called the color walk to develop your awareness and hone the skill of noticing. Misbah talks about how to compartmentalize the overwhelming influx of information in your mind, so that you can use it instead of it using you. The bar is no longer the only place where you might find your partner. Gyms have slowly become like mating palaces. There are low key baboons on the hunt -- everywhere. Kelsi and Misbah talk about some of the weirdest approaches she's had at the gym. What should you NEVER EVER do? What has worked? What hasn't? And why? You will either be able to relate to this because you've seen it in action, it's happened to you, or you've thought about trying it. Either way, you will probably laugh your ass off.  Misbah talks about Blu Blockers and having those eyes behind shades at night time. This episode is geared towards beginners who would be interested in producing higher quality photos and videos. What camera should you invest in? What accessories are essential? What editing software do you need? And how do you start to build the skills necessary to create a finished product? Misbah talks about the game changing manifesto for creatives out there trying to share their work. This concept can be applied to business owners, podcasters, coaches, you name it."
